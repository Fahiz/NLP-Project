+ Premium Phone at Budget Price Its almost 15 days since I am using this #Superphone.The phone delivers more than expected. Its beyond expectations.New Observations - Build Quality - Excellent Build quality. It survived a 5 feet drop on a marble flooring. Nothing happened to phone at all, not even a tiny scratch on the screen or at the back.User Interface - Now, as i am used to this UI, it feels pretty good now. Letv has also announced next version of this UI, ie., EUI 6, so on UI part, no complaints.Battery - Though battery life was somewhat low on initial days, but now, I get decent battery life that lasts for 1 whole day. Moreover, battery life would also be optimized with the new OTA update.Customer Service - Haven't visited a service center as of now, but had a talk with Letv Customer Care regarding some minor software bug. Unlike other companies, Letv customer care executive was listening to the query very patiently and his response was also satisfactory.  
+ Premium build and value for money Pros: full hd display is good..viewing angle really great.looks premium.. no body will believe this phone costs only 11k.. because lookwise can comparable with above 20 k phones finger print sensor 8 out of 10 times working flawelessly i experienced no lag so far quick charging is grt from 15 percent to 100 percent in 90 minutes IR BLASTER supports all kind of tv but in ac blue star and o genaral support is not there. Built quality is simply awesome....full metal for 10 k is really nice cons: ram management is poor .. out of 3 gb ram after installed 20 apps..... only 700 to 800 mb free ram available all time.... camera is not as good as mi4i and k3 note eui is okay but cant compete with miui.....battery is above average onl not too good.. but fast charging is there so v can satisfy with it while charging i experienced warm on sides. but thats common in quick charging final verdict: value for every penny u invested....  
+ a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality.    
+ bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices.    
+ i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the  flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like.    
+ overall i 'm happy with my toy.   
+ in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera.    
+ with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet. and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image.    
- Heat Issue Phone looks good Use it like toy in show case Major problem is heating issue -- U cannot spend more time with this phone  if you use it for long calls your ear will burn if you want to browse more your hand will burn.  
- Good phone but very poor Battery and Horrible Camera I was in a dilemma whether to go for K4 Note or Le 1S and after a lot of reviews, i gave it for Le1S. I was so excited that i could book the phone in the flash sale and even more excited till the phone arrived. The phone looks extremely stylish and premium. However, am so disappointed with its Battery performance and Horrible Camera.  
- No gyroscope,poor software,battery drain and heati It's a pretty good deal. Most of the buyers already know its pros. If you get a chance to buy it then you should go ahead.  But...you should know that they don't include a gyroscope in the phone for some reason.(which means no photo spheres or games that use the sensor don't work) Not a big deal for most people.  I also faced heating issues constantly. And, the battery drained really fast which is unusual. The skin also neglects to show a battery graph. While I hate skins in general, the eUI skin isn't as intuitive or feature rich as MIUI 7. The company has a long way to go before they catch up with Xiaomi. Hopefully, the development community will thrive.  Call quality is subpar at best. I didn't find the voice clear or loud enough at max volume.  Camera is quite terrible. Not sure what went wrong. Shots are usually blurry or extremely grainy. It's also a bit worrying that the company hasn't confirmed an update to Marshmallow yet.  
- Heating heavily and drastic charging if we use phone 30 mins .heating the phone heavily. look is good. charging is not up-to the mark. only 1 gb ram is available.  
- Worst camera quality not Recommended I bought this phone & I was Satisfied of its design and Other Features such as fingerer Sensor lock but I am total Dissatisfied with its camera as the picture quality is worst. Clicked Picture get Blured when I zoom it. Please guys those are photos freaks please do not buy this phone. another thing which i realized is that Comapny Gave 3GB RAm in this phone but customer will only get 1.2 GB available free memory which is too low.  
+ Excellent Product from Letv Fully charged battery from 0% to 100% it took exactly 1hour30min. Used it for few min and slept. Next day morning the battery level is still 100%. I am very surprised. I used the mobile for another 15min still it is 100%. Battery assistant is in Ultra-long stand by mode. I think it does all this wonders. Extraordinary battery!! Don't believe the negative comments about the battery. Regarding fast charging, my phone got charged 65% in 45minutes and I felt WOW. No lag at all so far.. Will update further..   
- LETV 1s GREAT DESIGN LOOKS WITH POOR PERFORMANCE Flipkart's service is excellent I GOT MY MOBILE ON 4 the FEB MORNING BUT LETV 1S MOBILE IS NOT FULFILL YOUR EXPECTATIONS. Average mobile great design build look.but there are problems like camera quality is very poor,minor software bug.battery life is not so good,heating issues Overall average mobile.  
- Not Worthy 1. heating very big problem... after using 15-20 minute it start heating a lot 2. Its Battary drain very fast, it doen't long last for 1 day. 3. camera Quality is very very poor.  
+ its a blast.....5 star the phone is much more than i expected...it has an awesome metal body and has a good feel in had....the graphics is excellent and games work outstanding...the camera is also superb ....the sound clarity is much more than the other phones in the segment...the phone is so fast and there is no lag ....and theres a lot of space in phone memory...the finger print sensor is pretty fast and recognises so well... and the features is awesome in this phone and is any one planning to buy a phone in this segment go for it..... its a great deal for the price and its more than worth.... and i rate 5 star for the product  
+ Performance is excellent I Bought this phone yesterday.. Positive Points 1.Camera Quality is Good 2.HD Display 3.Slim & Good Design 4. 4G Supports 5.Latest Android Version Negative Points 1. Less Internal Storage  
+ Awesome phone. Hello friends, I am writing this review after 2 days of usage. I always compare/read reviews before buying any products.  Pros:  *It arrives in style via ekart. *Flipkart packing is very nice and protective. *Weight of phone including battery is quiet light. *Look and feel is very much attractive, my colleagues compared with their expensive samsung phones, this phone also looks of same segment. *Fine details on edge looks posh, it gets broader at the bottom, overall it is great.  *UI and 5.1 lollipop is simple and very organised. *Music setting has a feature called Adapt sound, it enable every individual to fine tune the amount of sound for both ears, so that it suites you best without hurting your eardrums. The earphone which come is bad for music lovers, try getting your best brand's headphone, I use sony xb400 (old one,that time price was aprx 2K) it bounces nice. ;) * Apart from this every feature is nicely blended to cooperate daily life activities.  *There is no heating issue yet. *This phone is definitely value for money product.  Cons:  *No notification lights. *No themes *Less default wallpapers   
+ Nice & worth for money Excellent phone . Using it since 3 days .... battery backup is nice .... amazing camera quality ... Processing is fast ... 4G is awesome .... Worth for money ... Go fot it ..  
+ Awesome Phn...under 10k frm samsung Nice phone from samsung under 10k. Camera n picture quality is very good. Processor also works fine..  
+ Good mobile at affordable price Can give good competition to other phone makers. Amazing fast, good features, and the biggest brand name "SAMSUNG". Prefer buying Samsung over any other Chinese phones, because at this price it can beat any other phone and woo factor also included.  
+ A Super phone! A great phone over all. But heats up every now and then. Not sure what makes it heat so much. clean maste shows CPU tem above 40 degree. not sure if this app is reliable. Other than this speaker, camera, display, finger print scanner etc is good as expected. Worth the money. Looks premium in every aspect.   
- Pathetic performer with gorgeous looks First the pros(very few) - Display is gorgeous - Built is premium - Touch response is good - No bloatware  - IR blaster is good Now the cons - Out of box, the finger print scanner didn't work, a factory reset fixed it - Hot, hotter and hottest, its gets hot even with basic operations, charging, using camera, heat is much more around the upper side of panel - While gaming, temperature reaches mid fifties, causing frame drops and lags, even with basic games like subway surfer, world cricket championship, yet to test with high end games - Pathetic ram management, I never get above 1.4 GB free even at idel state  - Worst of the cameras I've seen, no proper focus, pixelated images even with HDR mode - Don't even think about selfies  - Finger print is not so accurate, have to try twice every time - Battery drains like water leaking from a broken tap, did factory reset twice as suggested in few other reviews, but no use  
- First Impressions Good But Below are my comments Build and design is very nice.  >Display is again average  >Camera is very average! Don't buy this for camera!  >Performance which I think is the USP of this phone as expected is very snappy!  > I have some doubts on build quality and how it fares in long run needs to be seen! >i had used the phone for 9 hrs Battery is drains fast. >Phone tend to heat up to 53 degree to 55~C even while charging the device heats up too  > Random shut Down . > thirty party application Like Airtel APP does not work. and many other APP too  > Average phone Not worth for money  
+ Excellent Phone! I bought this mobile in the 2nd flash sale. After 1 and half days of usage, below are my observations. First of all, the mobile was delivered in a day as promised!! Thanks Flipkart for the commitment and keeping it up.  Looks : As soon as I unboxed it, I was like Wooooooow!!!!. The mobile looked premium! Excellent built - full metal body.  Feel : The mobile is not so heavy and its slim. 5.5 inch screen is wide enough for you to play around. The touch is amazing with absolutely no lag.  Speed : I installed more than 30 apps (Mixture of Games, business, social networking, etc). The switch between apps is good - All because of its 3 GB RAM/2.2 Ghz processor (user will be left with approx 1.7 GB RAM, rest is used by the phone). I ran Asphalt 8 in full graphics mode, and it was as smooth as butter. Camera : Camera is a bit let down. The photos are not crisp and even in the broad day light, there is some noise in the photos. I would say - Not a perfect blend with other features of the phone.  
- le 1s A heat Broiler ...Donot buy it for camera purpose cons : A heat broiler in my hand . camera is bad ( do not buy it for camera purpose ) . fast charging doesnt seem to work well . pros : Multi tasking , internet surfing and file transfer is super fast ... everything else other than this . My final verdict : better go for lenovo k4 note or wait for redmi note 3 / mi5  
+ BEST PHONE IN THIS BUDGET Read the comments of a few dissatisfied customers, was almost going to cancel my booking but then rolled the dice and went with it. Primarily, the phone looks awesome, I've got the gold model and you simply want to put it in a showcase for the world to see. The phone is built with premium materials and it would survive a fall or two. Benchmark wise it is faster than any other phone within twice its price range, and the day to day usage is buttery smooth. The phone has eUi built on top of android lollipop and it is a joy to find out the nifty little features that are built into it.  
+ value of waiting from launching event when it was on my hand i grab it in first sale...its a very nice phone under 11k.. camera is very good than lenovo and others. fast charging charges my phone 0% to 100% in just 70-80 minutes.. there is a little warming(not heating) problem and that is ok because it has 2.2GHz processor.. and I am sure LETV will fix this problem in next OTA update.. today I also grabbed one for my brother..  
- Worst camera quality not Recommended I bought this phone & I was Satisfied of its design and Other Features such as fingerer Sensor lock but I am total Dissatisfied with its camera as the picture quality is worst. Clicked Picture get Blured when I zoom it. Please guys those are photos freaks please do not buy this phone. another thing which i realized is that Comapny Gave 3GB RAm in this phone but customer will only get 1.2 GB available free memory which is too low.  
- OMG Never gonna satisfied with this I never went for any non branded Mobiles yeh i made a mistake with LETV LE 1S Poor Camera Quality Heating Problem Sensor will not properly..  
- Worst Product Plz Dont Buy this Product because it is heating to Much and camera is all dull it feels like ur using camera in black and white Era. their is no 3gb ram its only 1.5Gb ram. Beaware of before buying this product.  
- I dont recommend, User interface is very very poor there is no much more options in user interface. it has fullhd display but brightness is very poor need more brightness. heats like iron box. for the name sake its fast charging. battery dischargers fast. need to work more on ui. cool pad note 3 is better. it has lot of user interface, double tap to wake the screen, answer incomeing call while simply touch finger print sensor. this options not in this phone. very poor User interface.i dont recomended this.  
- Speaker & Mic Issues I am writing this review to bring awareness on this product. I had it replaced once and facing same subject mentioned issue with the second handset. Certainly, I am not happy with the product. The first handset had speaker problem - distorted voice and music and mic problem - other person complains of low voice.  
+ Excellent value for money Have been using the phone for month. The quality and finish of the product is excellent! Display quality is great and even the 5mpx camera is excellent for daylight shots. The photos are sharp without much pixelation and the colors are punchy. Stock lollipop is a beautiful and fresh interface. The phone performance is zippy and multitasking is smooth.   
+ Moto Google Super .. am using this phone from past 2 weeks , Looking good and Performance is also Good. better if having flash too. :  
+ Excellent budget phone Great phone at an awesome price.  Mostly a pure android experience with some of Motorola's nice tweaks.  The hardware is very capable - I noticed no slowdowns when messing around with the phone.  4G LTE is a huge addition to the Moto E.  The battery is not removable but so far has lasted a whole day no problem. Overall, a very nice phone that punches well above its weight and truly does 90% of what flagships can do for an eighth of the cost. If you want a phone for decent multitasking for daily tasks, while you're on the move, look no further.  
+ Go for it.. Excellent phone at excellent price from Samsung..  The best part Samsung did not followed the usual path of releasing the phone at higher price and then slashing the price after 6 months.. The camera both front and rear and the camera apps are really good for quick photography.. Picture quality is really good..  Those who expect DSLR quality from a phone.. Its too much of an asking.. Overall satisfied with the product.. The only thing I miss is the Corning Gorilla glass.. Only concern as of now...  
+ Good mobile Gold colour of this phone is the striking feature. It looks very beautiful and unique apart from the traditional white and black. From distance it will appear as metallic even though the back cover is very thin plastic. But the side frames are real metal.  The display is awesome and none other manufacturers can match the display quality of Samsung. The colours are vivid and rich. Watched trailer videos in youtube and it looked so clear and vibrant. Best in this margin.  The phone is very thin and light and very easy to hold in hand and gives very good grip. It comes with a charger giving 1A output, most phones comes with 0.7A-0.75A charger. So charging is quick. Though the length of the wire of the charger is very short, almost half of the regular ones. So need to keep the mobile very near to the switch. Multitasking is very good and I opened more than 10 apps without any lag or crash  
- worst phone ever performance is good but true 720p is not running smoothly even a sony's dual core processor like xperia sp,l runs 720p smoothly,camera not as expected...gaming performance is worst...  
- NOT WORKING WITH DUAL SIM I have just received my samsung j5, but i am disappointed as the phone is not working properly when using dual sims. Firstly, the phone do not rings on incoming calls either on sim 1 and sim 2 Secondly, when i am doing outgoing calls it does not ask which sim should i use. ( I had already set the option "to ask everytime")  
- REALLY POOR THE PHONE HANGS TO MUCH ONLY 300 TO 400MB RAM IS FREE EVERYTIME THE PHONE IS HAVING HEATING PROBLEM AS WELL. IN JUST 8 DAYS I REALLY THINKS THAT IT WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE I AHVE EVER MADE  
- below average phone poor battery backup, as per the phones spec showing 2640 Mah battery but it won't last for one day with rare data usage, if we switch on the data we can see the battery indicator working as a speedometer, it's draining like anything. Having heating issue with this phone also. Other issue is very slow may be because of less RAM or with processor issue. Speaker volume is very low, they are providing the conventional flat type head set not the earbud type. Totally the phone is not value for money.  
+ Good value for money TV in this range I bought this TV because of its smart features and price range. No other brand is available in this range for similar specifications. Yes this is an Android 4.2.2 Jellybean TV but lacks most of the Android feature. The things I liked are: Picture quality is good.Sound quality is good.Looks attractive.Runs on Android.  
+ Better product at lowest price It looks very good and the picture quality is super. Long time waited for a good full hd TV but flipkart offered UHD, don't miss this.  
- Worst Product from Micromax Forget HD & 4K, the Picture clarity is worst. Movies appear like pirated.  Lip moments and Picture moment doesnt sync with sound. The main features sound and picture clarity are worst. What else can we expect apart from these. Browser never connects though WIFI is connected. Guys plz dont buy this product from Micromax.  
+ THE BEST TV FOR THE BEST PRICE EVER!!! This TV is exceptionally awesome.....The delivery was done within a day of the order....Dont even think before you buy this tv.!! JUST GO FOR IT!!  
+ very good awesome trimmer for my beard , it has 0.5 mm accuracy which means you can adjust the size to more precision. charges in 10 hours,gives a good bacup,and it has a pretty good look.  
+ Best Cheap Phone By Xiaomi(4g LTE) Xiaomi Gives a Best Phone at 7k. Battery is very good and no heating Issue, OTG supported and many more.....  Flipkart fast delivery is very nice at 90 Rupess. Overall the Phone is Excellent at all modes  
- Heating and battery drainage A bad product. battery drains out very fast and heating problems.  Many people are facing the same problem and it's not going even after upgrading to latest software.  
+ Best Mobile Redmi Fully customization available in the UI , OS is awesome, with the Hardware Good in specifications, camera front & rear both excellent The UI , speed ,screen, everything makes you fall in love  Excellent battery backup, performance and awsome camera...need I say more?  
+ Underdog Prime ! Came with excellent packaging thanks to Flipkart... built quality is premium of this device, excellent call quality.. dual sim 4g,3g works topnotch. camera quality is excellent if you know how to take pictures :) playing games is a bliss..i have installed Trine2 , Leo's fortune, Yurei ninja, Monument valley,Asphalt8, fruit attacks,angry birds 2, plants vs zombies 2 .. thanks to 2gb ram and 16gb rom.. everything is SMOOTH no lags. battery is a plus point, with quick charging tech i can charge 20% to 60% in just half hour..ofcourse i am using my own Asus 2amp adapter. led notifications are cool, can change different colors, got latest MIUI update of 625mb which is super stable.. this mobile is practically everything that i want !  
+ Decent product, value for money product Its been 2 days using this phone, Touch is smooth, display is good, Pictures & Video quality is decent. Build and design is smooth. Screen Mirroring & OTG is supportable. Sound is also good with good volume. The only thing noticeed is that the phone gets heat up while charging. otherwise its a very good phone @6999/-  
- Dont buy if you are buying it for calling. missing the basic requirement of phone i.e its ability to make calls. most of the time you wont find signal on sim 1.It is having very poor network strength on sim one.calling experience is very poor.  
+ NICE PHONE ...........LOVING IT AT THIS PRICE I had purchased Redmi2 prime.. on 14th of aug.. it is good ... no heating issue... the phone is handy...battery backup is gppd....no complaints.........this phone price is less compared to mi4i................... overall nice phone....  
- There is a manufacturing defect in this phone. I purchased this phone and realized that it is heating up too much even if the phone is kept idle and battery was draining very fast. I have told to perform so many thing such as updating latest software, resetting the phone, but all in vein. Also, I visited lenovo service center and they suggested me to get the phone returned to Flipkart. I got it replaced with a new phone but still the same issue. Even I can say it was more than that. I got a message on the phone " WARNING! OVER BATTERY TEMPERATURE".  
- very bad phone i brought this phone during the big billion days..although this phone really boasts about its nice specs, the actual usage shows that the phone is not worth. it gets hot even for a small usage, the battery, drains down to 23 % from 100%, within 2 hours even after keeping the phone in flight mode. overall i am very much unsatisfied with this product.  
- Its a HEADACHE!!!! Pathetic product, Heating issues, loudspeaker sound is bad, Save your money. once its heated, battery drains fast as hell! Camera n rest things are good. but can find better products in market  
- Cheap hardware.Average screen, not very good viewing angles, colours get darker when phone is tilted a bit. Speakers installed on the phone suck, they are hardly audible and sound very cheap. You hardly hear the incoming call tone even after volume is maxed. Camera though they say is 8 MP but pics taken in any setting are noisy and blurry. Disappointed hugely with the camera. Far more superior features on the paper, very cheap product and quality. I feel like I should not have bought this phone.  
- Lenovo A6000 plus phone is getting switched off I just bought Lenovo A6000 plus few days back, and it got delivered on last day, though the phone seem good for money in terms of design and other features, i am very much disappointed with the performance. First of all I was trying to register on first use and it was not working properly, the phone is taking too much time to charge to 100 percent, and the phone is getting switched off every now and then. In the last 24 hours, the phone was switched off for 5 times without any warning or anything, and everytime we have to remove the battery and put it ON to switch on the phone. It is really annoying. I am planning to exchange the phone through Flipkart, while I was searching over google i found out there are many pieces with the same issues. So be careful while buying this phone. I am really disappointed.  
- sound is poor Incoming calls volume is very poor compare with other mobiles. Other remaining features are good. volume feature is not attractive.  
- No to lenovo Got my phone on 3rd nov 2015.excellent delivery from flipkart.. This phone is not that amazing.. Ok agree price is less n specifications are good. But I am facing over heating problem on calls.. (No games played as yet) also there is a major issue with Call.voice is not clear at all on both the ends..distraction on fluctuating voice..i would recommend rather go for samsung or sony.. Lenovo is not the choice despite of specifications provided.. Camera quality is worst as compared to other phone of the same range.. Its a BIG NO to lenovo  
+ nice phone it works fine...nice phone in handsome amount. battery is ok. camera is superb....and comfortable to you...in simple words the best phone in its range,.........................  
- One of the worst mobile -The mobile camera quality is very bad. -The User interface is very bad. -The built in quality is worst. -After using it for 2 weeks it shows the charging issue,it stop charging after 40%. -There is no ear phone with this mobile. -Sometimes when you restart the mobile it shows no network,u have to change the network setting every time u restart the mobile.  
+ Light weight, looks slim, great features & affordable price makes this a masterpiece Light weight, looks slim, great features & affordable price makes this a masterpiece Got this phone in App offer at 6299/- even more happy for it as its original price is 7500/- Already recommended this to my friends and family Without a doubt can have this as a budget phone with all required features  
+ Excellent Mobile... This is my review after 15 days of usage of this mobile... Very Best mobile i have ever bought... decent 8mp camera quality, good battery backup, mainly this comes with 4G capability which made me more happier, display quality is also good, decent value of 2 GB RAM makes it work in great speed and no lagging atall. call quality is also good. charging seems to be taking some extra time... i have read lots of charging issues in user reviews but i am not experiencing such problems... overall great... I think it more worthier than 7500 what we are paying...  
+ Awesome Phone. Today it got delivered to me. Very nice mobile and intelligent enough. For 7.5K, i would say, this is the best mobile. So far, i didn't see any drawbacks  
- Not recommended to a friend.. it is an average product..not good looking at first view...screen also dull comapre to other phone..i not support this product at this category..it is too.... high price for this product..  
- very poor performance relieved this product easily and only one day after I am sorry to say - this product is not up to the mark. touch screen is very poor, very light weight hand set but handset become very hot in few minutes of use.... hopeless return policy. seller given msg to me from flipkart that this product can not return. I am suggesting you people please do not buy this product...  
- lenovo a6000 plus waste of money i bought the phone a week ago. and it is heating up like an IRON BOX and the battery backup is terrible it cant keep the charge for an hour. i asked for a refund but they keep saying they would call me back but they never do. so my request never buy this phone.  
+ Love It Phone is awesome. Esp Red color has great look to it. Speed and UI are great. especially if you are bored of old samsung and Sony interfaces. Great price. Only a bit drawback is with camera. Rest ll is awesome nd great battery backup too  
+ awesome product i wil give 0 ut of 0 i am very happy to buy this product it is awesome product donot miss the chance i found this product at 38000 while its price at hp showroom was 44700 . it work very smooth and its speaker is also good but one thing is wrong that seller dont give laptop acessories as hp showroom give like screen gaurd keygaurd protector mouse etc but overall it is awesome product at this range.ITS colour is aiso good its keyboard is awesome and thnks to seller who deliverd at limited period of time. it give good battery backup  
- Problem with lenovo k3 heat and draining the battery and you can feel heat while talking to phone, you can feel this in 2 min. After starting the call. I can say this is bad design because charging port is at top of the phone near to ear piece. This should be at mic  
- More radiation please do not buy.This phone is having more radation. Not even talking for 2 mins. headache and some skin problems will come. specs are ok. not satisfacted if u are a heavy game lover then my humble request is not to buy this mobile.just received mobile yesterday and switched on it and i installed asphalt 8, what i noticed is it is lagging which will not let u enjoy the game at all and iam very much disappointed with this. even clash of clan is also lagging. it is only recommended for those who wont play much games and use for calling(max) pros:good battery,large internal memory,large screen.cons:bad bad camera,it clearly lags,u will definitely hate this,heating problem  
- Headphones missing, Camera photo quality is not good.Headphones is missing, It is not part of Mobile Accessories.  Camera photo quality is not up to the mark as compare to other with same price range. lenovo VIBE Theams(UI) is not that interesting as compare to others bad.  
- BAD EXPERIENCE-LENOVO SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO PROVIDE BETTER PRODUCT I was quite excited when booked this killer note on the first flash sale. BUT when i used this phablet it was below my expectation. Very important issue is it's heating problem, Whenever i charge or use 3G data it starts heating abrubtly and temp reaches upto 48 C. This is weird. Lenovo should do something to resolve this issue. Its rear camera is also not upto the mark. It gives you an image like an 8MP camera. Its high SAR value is a serious problem too. I am regretting on my choice as lenovo fails in providing a good product.  
- Heating Problem.everything is good........the only cons i find is the heating problem.....its getting hot after a short time usage. Its quite disappointing.  
- camera is worst.camera clearity is very worst.front and back both are very bad clearity. single star for camery and hanging problem  
+ Proud and happy owner of Lemax Gold The phone is great. You have to experience the Stunning Visual display to believe it. Larger screen will be the order of the day, but it can be comfortably held. Battery life and heating is not a problem as discussed. Speed is fantastic. Looks good. Highly Recommendable. Gaming and video viewing is a great experience.  
+ Letv Le Max Very good phone. Brilliant storage space. Very good camera as well.Only battery could be slightly better.  
+ Worth to buy Good looking, stylish, good performance, battery also good . Fully matal body and smooth display. Finger device also fast response.  
+ overall good phone I purchased this phone yesterday... it works very good...build quality is good, camera is ok, battery backup very good and most good one is finger print sensor... we should not expect more than this at this price, I like very much honor 5x  
+ Awesome phone This is the best smart phone under 15k. aweso me crystal clear photos can be clicked on it, terrific battery and overall phone performance. Worth the price tag.  
- Disappointed!!! Looks: Stylish back panel but from front it looks very cheap. Lags during normal usage. camera is good under sunlight but very poor in low light conditions. Video playback is dull, doesn't look like a screen with 401 ppi. HEATS!!! Even during normal usage of 10 minutes, phone heats up around fingerprint sensor area, area around rear camera, near earpiece  I've returned my Honor 5x for the heating issues.  
+ Awesome Phone in 10 K The phone looks quite good with the price range. The display is awesome and the battery backup is good. The ZEN UI is too awesome. However the UI might use some of the ram. My sincere request is to update the phone. We get around 800 - 900 mb free ram and things work quite smooth with the available ram. Coming to camera in daylight it captures good photos however in low light the picture is little granular. i guess its the same with other phone not to mention it is a 10 K phone. So i would say its a nice phone with good display in 10K.  
+ awesomeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Mobile. Camera like DSLR.  Superb battery life.  HD Display. Gorilla Glass 4. Low price. Totally excellent quality mobile.  
+ awesome awesome awesome... this phone is amazing , it looks fantastic and design was uniqe better than other phone..... battery backup good , phone running smoothly, display was better than other branded phone... fabulous sensetive camera everything was automatically adjusted both front and rear.......photos are good quality like dslr.......go for it.........  
+ Excellent and Awesome Phone for 10K. Thanks for quick delivery from Flipkart got it on 30th Aug. itself. Phone is operating very smoothly, Excellent touch, fabulous design, vast screen, also pretty sleek. Camera is fantastic, No lagging, Battery Backup very good. Also one can use all the slots avail. Only one drawback is Sound quality which is bit low, but overall I would def. suggest to for this one if anyone is planning to buy phone under 10K. Far better than Lenovo K3 Note.  
+ Excellent device from Apple I have been using iPad air 2 for the past six months. The build quality is fantastic and it has a fabulous display. I am a fan of both iOS & Android. Tablet specific Apps are great in iOS. Battery life is also very good. As usual Flipkart delivered it on time.   
+ Awesome Product & Genuine Seller. This is Awesome Product & Looks Classy. Moreover Shipping From WS Retail Seller Was Also Up to Expectations. Nice Product.  
+ Perfect Budget Phone I have been using this phone for few days and I will fully satisfied with the phone.  The phone perfectly fit in my hand and the build quality is superb.  
- Refund My Amount I am not satisfied with Moto G(3rd Generation), after purchase this cellphone facing so much Problem, hanging problem , Battery Discharge with in 15-20 Minute & biggest Problem in this phone its heat too much that i can't touch. So Can't use this phone, I request you please refund my amount As Soon As Possible.  
- Worst product ever had .. poor internet , hanging problem i had samsung and asus 501cg but above all i purchased motog 3 gen 16 gb , but very unhappy from the phone as net is poor , hanging problem is there , no user friendly . not interested to keep this phone .... lets wait for the flipcart team to revert . purchased 5 days ago .  
- Extremely Disappointed Phone starts heating within 20 minutes of use , the screen gets unbearably hot and battery drains down like anyything  
- very poor hardware quality slider is very poorly designed. moreover the drive is very small and OTG will slip while connecting with a phone. better not to buy slider design.  
- poor performance I bought this 3.0 SanDisk but the performance is poor. Not so great compare to 2.0. Basically it opens in only few smart phones not for all mobile phones. Even I tried to install app in my smart phone and it does not work at all  
+ Excellent.I found this product extremely user friendly and satisfactory. The mouse is perfectly designed and provides an excellent grip. The sensitivity is calibrated to the finest.  
- Horrible - Worst mouse ever Cant believe Logitech actually manufactures this kind of rubbish. Just feels like a really cheap duplicate chinese mouse that you can pick up on the footpath or chor bazaar. The mouse makes a rattle when moved around. The back flap keeps falling off exposing the insides. Easily the worst mouse i have ever bought. The build quality is horrible and something you would not expect from Logitech. As i said, this feels more like a cheap duplicate than logitecch product. Giving it a rating of 1 because thers no option of zero!  
- Bad Product.Battery consumtion is very high.Left / Right click is very bad.So, nothing is good in this product.  
- worst buy mouse has stopped working after 1 month of low use, cant even return now. don't buy this product. Delivery was fine I have got no issues with that but build quality is low, if it cant go beyond one two months rather go with local cheap ones.  
- low quality.am not at all comfortable with the product... logitech has more different models better than this. also there is no light of laser so have to check whether the mouse is on or off  
+ i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .   
+ have used it frequently and have had no problems .   
+ i liked this one enough to buy another .   
+ my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .   
+ great quality picture and features .   
- they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them . .i am back to using # 1 .                
+ very good laptop work very find with good battery life window 10 pre installed  good wifi range batter for basic daily use  
+ Excellent laptop value for money..REALLY IMPRESSED BY THE PRODUCT...EXCELLENT FEATURES AT VERY LOW COST ....THE FEATURES ARE GOOD.....THE PRODUCT IS VERY STURDY ..LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST THE PACKING WAS VERY GOOD  
+ A good value for money. Screen is awesome. Sound quality is excellent. Battery life is good But storage is low. What will you get more than this in 15k :p Overall a money worth product.  
- Poor Camera All other features are same as other models from Samsung. I was excited about from 5mp camera with flash, however the quality of pictures that this 5mp takes is very poor. Also, quality of pictures primary camera takes is super poor. I would suggest not to buy this, nothing new, in fact have lower down in terms of camera quality.  
- Completely disappointed with the sound quality of this phone The ringtone and music quality is worst.... but I like the camera quailty and screen display very much on this phone.  
- Not satisfactory Often hangs. Many stay one sim not reachable while using cellular data on other sim  
- Camera and Sound Quality Not Good I am NOT satisfied with camera quality and sound quality of this product......  
- Samsung J7 Please don't Purchase Samsung J7 this mobile was automatic switch off  Memory Card slot not working properly am inserted only 16gb Memory card Automatic memory card rejected waste Mobile  
- camera Clarity very poor Samsung J7 front and back camera clarity is very very poor.  But mbile slim is ok and battery back up power is ok.  
- worst of money Very poor sound quality. Never buy this phone. Totally waste of money. If you want to buy this mobile so buy another one mobile also for music.  
- waste product its getting struck automatically, turning off, going into programming mode, waste of money please dont go for it.  
- not so good i used this product for 5 days now. the display and battery backup is good but the camera is very bad , my old grand 2 camera is much better then this . also the speaker out put is very low .  
- Cant' expect this quality from Samsung Everything is near to fine in this phone regarding price display etc. But sound quality of speaker is very poor if you ir traffic or @ market or any even in at less noisy place, it will be not clearly hear able that your phone is ringing 5 out 10 time u will missed the call due to bad quality of speaker  
+ Excellent product Recommended for low budget and high performance. Video recording is excellent. Also is front and rear camera.  
+ Excellent Great phone. My son uses this and is very happy. Just go for it. Am definitely buying this again for my wife and my daughter.  
- Not satisfied at all This phone is not a quality phone. I am in Canada and i ordered 2 phones through your website. The other phone is a an excellent phone. but this phone we cant even hear what the other person is saying.   
+ Good phone as a good price I paid less I got less! Still working good. Satisfied with the price paid. I cannot expect more from the amount I paid. I cannot expect a S5 function from Guru!!  
- Worst phone The purpose of going to a mobile with this price is that the mobile will be used only for the basic things. But this purpose fails when it fails to serve the purpose. Call quality is disgusting.. i bought it for one old guy... Very disgusting.. not able to hear properly what others is speaking.. Have got a very worst mobile. Samsung- a cheap phone manufacturer without quality. My rating would be 0-0.5.  
+ Exceptional call quality! It's a very good product for people who cannot or do not want to use smartphones. It is exceptionally sturdy and simple to use. Great value at this price.  
- Poor voice clarity Well, the most basic and important purpose of a cellphone is to communicate. With this phone you wont be able to hear the opposite person clearly. There is loudness but not clarity, if you know what i am talking. You will hear the other person loud but you wont be able to understand what he is speaking. The speaker or the ear piece is not built for clarity. So this phone is totally useless. Disappointed with samsung in this price range.  
- Alarm sound is so low I don't know this model itself is like this or my product is defective. Alarm sound is so feeble that It can't wake me up. Other features are OK.  
- very bad experience display is very small..and in call history number is moving not stable so it is inconvenient to see the number.  
+ Excellent battery support...... Affordable,easy to use. Excellent battery support......:-) Simple........! Good for non-tech savvy people !  
+ Great phone at cheaper price This is great phone at price it was offered battery life is very good. Its worth for money, sound quality is good. best for basic function  
- FAULTY PIECE DISPLAY RBG PROBLEM IN MOBILE DISPLAY RBG BLUE COLOUR IS NOT WORKING.DISPLAY ISSUE.MOBILE IS FAULTY PLEASE REPLACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  
- Not Good Automatically restarting while calling, even after servicing also same problem. Pls dont buy this phone.  
- Unsatisfied Hanging Problems starts at 1st day itself..back & Front camera not bad...battery backup good .....very worst delivery .....Y charging cable 20cms scale size this is very lenthy for us  
- hangs a lot.... Plz don't buy this shit from samsung....i used this phone for one week so i can easily tell you some cons..... Hangs on small games.. If u remove your battery from device for any reason it shows half of battery after swithing it on... 13 mp camera is a joke....my old micromax device with 8 mp camera gives far better picture quality  
- Not good I bought this mobile one month back, really it is worst. Getting speaker problem within one month. Please don't buy this product.  
- cheap quality Please do not buy this phone....very low quality...look wise very cheap, headphones like a rs. 200 cost.go for Motorola G 3 . Seriously guy's. .not a quality phone. Rating given 1 by me because no option less thn 1  
- don't buy this phone lots of hanging issue & heating also phone not working properly heating issue and hanging  some times videoplayer not working keypad not working while using net it get more heat  
- worst at battery lifetime battery was 10 days from buying ok, then worst if wifi or data is used, Now it is showing frequently decrements in he charge , battery part. worst in battery. music system is confusing. camera modes are not easy to operate. night mode was not there in camera.  
- bad camera and low ringtone I bought J5 20 days before ; in the day light rear camera shot nice quality pics but in the night , even if you use flash light , the rear camera gives a very dull quality pics like a 1.2 mp camera. i was so surprised .. is it a s/w issue or h/w limitation . i took a pic in night with a samsung dual core, which has a 5 mp camera, and its quality was better than J5 13 mp camera in in night time.. Rigntone volume is very low.  
- SAmsung Guru 1200 not user friendly I got fade up with the performance of the phone. within one month the phone is started giving Problem in phone microphone and speaker. now its uncommon charging pin is not working. So its totaly dead... useless. why not samsung is making the common usb charger for all phone?  
- Poor Product - Many call drops Who ever buys this phone will buy for a simple reason - Calling. I am okay as long as it supports uninterrupted calling. But unfortunately, this phone creates many issues related to calling. Calls drop so frequently and voice quality is bad. I have been using the same sim in another phone for more than an year and is not a sim issue. Why would anyone buy anything if it does not support the basic reason for the product's existence?  
- very badd mobile i bought this phone and it is getting hanged again n again think b4 u buy  
+ Good for simple use I have bought this product for my cousin as he wanna present a gift to his fiancee. the product which got delivered shortly is just too good and worth the money. i strongly recommend this to one who use their mobile for texting and calling. Most importantly,It is a stylish product.  
+ great product It is really great product and customer support is also very very good.simple to use easy to maintain  
+ Good one Nice product , worth the price , battery backup is excellent, need not charge it for 4 days after once charged           
- Not as expected ....not as bad too...phone get heated up with use of over 30 min or so...battery back up not not as stated.....but sound and look awesome .... 
+ Superb phone....no any complaints till now. 
+ Good product . but there are severe problem of heating.it even heats even with lite games 
- Not suggested due to speaker quality, battery and mobile heat issue 
- Worst Service Center. Pathetic Customer Service. Don't Buy This Phone Just Because Of Its Specs and Price. Don't buy any OnePlus phone. Stick to well-established companies with great service centers and awesome reputation for customer service.
+ This is an excellent phone. As long as it doesn't get any issues. You can't imagine the horror you will have to face to try to get this phone fixed or repaired.
- Worst phone ever. I travel very often, and every time I land in a new city the phone doesn't automatically connect to my cellular network, even though auto network has been selected. i always have to manually configure the network, until then i have no network. Worst was when I was drove outside the city, for long time i didn't get any call. Only when I checked I noticed. It never connected to the roaming network on its own. I wish I could return this piece of crap 
+ Awesome budget phone, needs some tweaks to become perfect. VR is an issue. Otherwise good. check pics. 
+ Awesome phone with all features with less prise. Don't miss it guys. U guys love it. Camera awesome. Normal heating issues. Multi tasking. Very fast. Nice design.fast finger print sencer What else u want in 7k . Don't think. Just buy it. 
- Only plus point is camera is good rest is worst. Sometimes hang without anything , I have not installed any application on this. phone get over heated while charging and in calls. Even I have done factory 2 times but no go. I will not suggest anybody to purchase this phone. If I can return it I will be more happy. It is really waste of money. I was biased from one plus one performance. 
+ the phone exceeds all expectations, super smooth and lag free operation, nice touch, great build quality , good battery backup, a good screen , great camera ..... the phone's actually worth every paisa .....maybe more than that.
+ only 3 days .. yeah got my keypad lock once received. user manual is not that helpful, earplug is not there apart from these two awesome phone . based on 3 days usage.. I fall in love with the camera. voice quality good. trying to change the font type but not able to. value for money. 
+ Very good phone but only drawback is battery life is not enough and phone gooes dead midday as gets out of battery. More so as one tends to use a lot of apps.If just use for phone will last whole day.
- Mobile was working good for a week, all of a sudden started hanging up calls and displays error message "cellular network not available". I tried rebooting, even restoring factory settings but still not able to make or attend calls. Handset heats up unnecessarily. Feel disappointed, this was my first purchase from Amazon. Wonder will I even be replaced with a working mobile. Tech team or customer support Pl revert
- The Mobile is getting too much over heated during charging, while talking in phone, while using internet. I did not play any games so not sure how much it would get heated. First I bought one +2 and used it for 2 days. due to this heating problem, again I got replaced with new handset. Even that also had the same problem. So I returned the replaced product and asked for amount refund. Not sure whether every one+2 phone has this problem or only with those phone's which I bought. Features wise it's a good phone and if this heating issue was fixed then you can't get better phone than this in this range.
+ Worth the cost and much better than other oneplus phones, and any other phone at 20k+ of its range!!. The apps are also fast, the figure print sensor is very useful for me (its always annoying to search for the unlock buttons on the phone).
- Hi this is abhilash i recently purchased oneplus 2 handset from amazon, i am experiencing major problems on battery heating, the mobile gets hanged often and will not respond for a minimum time of 20 mins, during this i cannot even restart the mobile. I sincerely suggest u people not to purchase this mobile in future beware!!! Im rating it zero.
+ After hearing lot of reviews i decided to take this flagship killer, For every phone there are good features and specs for that price we are spending, But the features they are providing should have quality too, that is the best thing i had seen in this mobile. They are few defects and heating problems in the software and processor side, I think after few updates they can modestly reduce some of the issues which everyone are facing.
- I am sure a lot of you reading this review may not have similar issues but I thought I should voice it out. My phone is in its fourth month now and has already started hanging. The screen freezes and sometimes the pull down menu also freezes. The software is up to date and I have even reformated the phone. However the issue continues. The battery back up is also not too great and it hardly last seven hours with moderate use. I am not sure if this is a particular issue with my phone only or if it's common. Anyway I am disappointed with the phone and my trust on the company is shaken. Let's hope the next update solves these issues. - Mike of this phone is very weak. Other side person not listen speech. Also speakers sound very low can't able to get higher level of sound. Camera is very good, but setting of camera is very difficult to understand. Other performance is OK. I give 49 msrks out of 100
+ Really Good Product by Lenovo.camera I is excellent....Features will surely impress you..Battery is long lasting . sound is Excellent. only Headset is not given with device .over all good device by LENOVO.
- I am having a weird issue not sure if anyone else is facing or not. While call is connected I am not able to disconnect the call. Touch doesn't work. In other cases its work just fine.
+ Awesome cellphone good to use brighter display loved the finger print sensor gesture control few features like knock display direct recive all good one the only thing didnt like is cell overheat unnecessarly even the finger sensor when i touch with my fingure i feel that its hot to not there fault its the porcessor which is cheap one they used rest all good enjoying the cell
- The product is not up to the mark, i have purchased & received it on 20th Feb 2016. Instrument is not supporting 2G/3G /4G data flow. Being a new product purchased, i am very much disappointed. Amazon is also having NO Refund policy on mobile phones which is against market trend, which will surely have negative impact on future buyers.
- Hangs a lot. Almost all apps stops indefinitely. Sound is low when compared to another K4 of my friend. Mobile not at all vibrates now. Over heating while charging. Touch sometimes not working. Its been just 30 days I'm using the mobile, but found lot of problems. Done reset and used in safe mode as instructed by Lenovo Tech support. But no change. Its really embarrassing to use the mobile. Its really a bad thing to go to the service center to repair the mobile which is just a month old.
+ The Phone is amazing.When compared to lenovo k3 note ,This is one is far better. Only the issue we will feel heat,While browsing more than an hour. But if you use panel over that. You can't feel anything. The camera quality is good. I saw in many review's they told that camera is n't good. I saw in one plus and in samsung grand max, when compared to them the camera quality is good. Good Specifications under 12k,Lenovo is best. Go For it. Don't thinkk...
- pathetic Phone,, hangs and Heats up too much... camera doesn't work at all.. did receive call from xiomi and hey asked me to do some settings, still facing the same problem.. no idea whom to contact.. customer care number dosnt work
- It heats a lot ..and battery drain from 100 to 50 in just 7 hours when untouched . camera is gud , performance is gud but phone is not preferred .so don't waste money and time with this product . gud luck
- Mobile condition after 11day is defective. The mobile is too hot after use some time,aand it's battery is empty after half an hour use. The defectiveness is shown after 10days of use. How can I replace or refund this mobile phone ?
- The seal on the box was broken by the time I received it. I was travelling around that time and I ordered it for a friend who needed it urgently therefore couldn't return it within the return window. Turned out, a week after the window closed, the mic stopped working and now I have to search for a service centre to get it serviced.
+ It is an amaging phone Excellent camera with sharp photos Excellent fingerprint function which works witin a second Good sound and bettery backup More than enough 3GB Ram and 16GB Rom What else we can get in R.s 7000. Excellent Mobile. 
+ Really nice phone at this price I don't get any heating issues till .. Finger print scanner is perfectly working & Battery comes around a day Really perfect phone at this price 
+ I would have loved to give 5 star but plastic back cover comes out too often. Very good at this price point, Very good VR experience, Excellent Amazon service. Thanks
- I think its not worth the popularity it has attained. Its just been 15 days that i bought this product and facing many issues. Its not that ive loaded many apps to make it slow. I have just the most important apps and No games at all.
- The contacts take more than a minute to open Even though a caller is saved in my contact list, the phone does not identify the caller when its ringing. The messages doesn't show in the message box even though it shows on notification box. Whatsapp Messenger works very slow many times. his phone has 3 GB RAM and hence shouldnt be so slow at all !! I have formatted it 2 times in last 15 days and also upgraded the OS but no solution. I also wrote to the service center but they haven't replied. My suggestion is PLEASE DON'T BUY !!
- 1. Mobile getting heated up within few minutes of operation. 2. Audio output is with "hiss" noise when SPEAKER is selected. 3. Battery is not withstanding for long operation.
- The order has a battery problem. The battery started draining very quickly. Also the phone gets hot too much that it becomes impossible to hold in hand.
- Xiaomi are very lazy company to provide update. When I use redmi 1s it's have problem with Spanish. when I wrote them they want me to install custom rom provide on unofficial site which clearly means break the warranty. Spanish work good in Android but it's broken in MIUI. Their software is not good either. Once I bought redmi 1s and move because of software issue. Hardware is fine. In future if xiaomi can improve their software or just give open-source cyanogenmod then it will be good otherwise it's better to use other options.
+ A good budget friendly device with great specifications This is reallya nice device. The device has really nice specifications like 1.5 Ghz Octacore Processor, 2 Gb Ram, 5.5" 720p display, 8 mp Rear camera and 5 mp front camera and relatively very low price. Because if you want a device with same specifications of brand like samsung or sony it would price more than 20,000 Rs. So, according to me this device is really very nice on the basis of its specs and price. Its not a flagship device but a good phone for a person who wants a good phone for low budget.
+ Awesone mobile Lenovo A 7000 - Very good mobile for me. How I use. Fast and furious.Processing speed is very fast.All apps running smoothly. Screen resolution so good. Brighten and Natural color. Front camera clarity is wow. Mobile have more features with lolipop version. Sound is very good. But with headphones its awesome.Dolby atmos make sound touch to heart. One or two minor problem have, if u fix then no other mobile like that. First, Hotspot password show when hotspot is off. Plz see the image for detail. 2nd, No other button for screen shot.I am very happy to buy this mobile to Amazon. Very good products and service. Keep it up Amazon. .
- Not satisfied with Lenovo A7000 - I have purchased Lenovo A7000 what I am using for last 2 months but I am not happy with the product. Reasons are mainly two - I think mike is not working properly as the person on call at other end is always complaining about my voice is breaking but I am able to hear their voice clearly. 2ndly, camera is bad. I dont know whether this about my set or in general. Camera picture quality is below average and the worst part is that when I apply flash, pic becomes cloudy (white). I request advice from Amazon or seller what to do. 
- 2 out of 5 stars But the positive point is the battery backup is good. I am very much disappointed with the performance. Mobile is becoming very slow and sometimes it hangs. Not possible to reboot using power button. Need to remove the battery to restart. I have inserted second sim in the mobile and call logs are not displayed afterwards. But the positive point is the battery backup is good. I am very much disappointed with the performance of the phone. Hope someone at Lenovo do take of their mobiles and their performance. 
+ so good. It has a good touch response - I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, so far ,so good. It has a good touch response. Battery life is pretty good too. Yes, the earphones are of no use but at this price this is one of the best deals you can get. Sound quality is unbeatable, dolby atmos is surely the best it can get. There is no app drawer, but it wont make much of a difference. You can install the apps and data directly to the sd card.
+ Five Stars - Excellent phone from the mnc Lenovo with 2GB RAM.The octa core 1.5Ghz processor workes well.5.5 inch HD display is awesome. Light weight.Only drawback is heating issue which is common with mediateck processor. Camera works well as on the configuration.3G/LTE is available only in sim1 where as sim 2is just gsm.Overall score can be 4.3/5 Excellent service from Amazon...Amazing Amazon
- VERY POOR QUALITY HAND SET AND POOR AFTER SALES SERVICE - Very poor quality the touch was not working properly jus after one month of purchase....on top of that very poor service is being offered by the company my mobile is at the service center for the last two months not knowing when I will be delivered serviced mobile....friends don't buy this poor quality mobile
- very bad product and policy of Amazon is not very good - very bad product and policy of Amazon is not very good but very bad one week is very less for review of the Item i really hate Amazon retrun Policy must be one month Like Flipkart Or Myntra
+ very nice cell phone in yhe range of 15 k - This is a very awsm cell phone with Android version of lollipop.....with a very fine selfie front camera of 5 mgp and rear 8 mgp......... I am using this phone about 1/2 a month and realize that it's battery backup is very nice as compared to another phone in this range or higher........ And no hanging problem..... So who want to buy this ....don't confused with it....just close your eyes and order it....... Very very thankful to amazon because of its services.....
- 1.0 out of 5 starsPathetic phone from lenovo with multiple issues. - Pathetic phone for anyone to buy, as there are lot of manufacturing defects and technical issues that cannot be resolved. I bought this phone with good expectations but ultimately realize it was the biggest mistake to buy this pathetic phone. Even the repairs team doesn't stock spares and any part replacement would take 10-14 days.the headphones are low quality, mind me that these phones are manufactured in China wit india label on it.
+ best deal - Buyind a cellphone onlne is a tricky job...soo mny brands,varieties n offer....aftr two day brainstorming i zeroed down on this bcoz of the offer n battery bckup...amazon gav d cheapst offer thn othrs lke flpkrt...i shld say its a gret phne with vry gud screen resolution, camera quality, touch respnce, weight and overall handlng...its for my wfe ...far bettr thn my samsung of same prce range...highly recommended
- Package was as always good. On net usage battery life is just 12 - Package was as always good. On net usage battery life is just 12 to 14 hrs. On first charging phone heated up fastly but afterwards that complaint didn't arise.but on net usage it heats up. Sound quality is very good. Speed is also great. Sim 4G & 2G is only supported Camera front camera doesn't give that clarity pic The phone worthwhile for this price.
+ Nice smartphone! - I was a little skeptical about purchasing a smartphone online but the price seemed attractive so I tried amazon. The product was delivered before the stipulated date, so I was a bit surprised. The product is good. Overall, it was a good experience with amazon. Looking forward to making more purchases with Amazon!
- Touchscreen stopped responding within a month The righthand side of the touchscreen stopped responding within a month of receiving the phone. Have been chasing after Lenovo customer care since then, but they are as unresponsive....have been told twice that they have no spare parts. And no other help, information is forthcoming from them!
+ The phone is a good one with all the essential features The phone is a good one with all the essential features. The only shortcoming of this phone is that, although the memory is expandable, internal memory is not sufficient. Amazon specific review: The USB cable provided stopped working after a month.
- Touch Screen not working at all - It is unfortunate to state that only two months and a week has passed and touch screen of the said phone is not working, due to which I am not able to open the lock nor I am able to use it at all. Please replace the same as soon as possible. 
- iPhone heating-up I bought this device on 12th May 2015 & consignment was delivered on 15th May 2015, It is now 10 days & the device is heating up badly and consuming battery a lot i.e. battery back-up is low. Please let me know what to do. I think the device is a DOA product & wanted to replace with a Box Pack handset.
+ Good Phone. Got India 1 year warrenty  verified iPhone 5s was first released 2 years ago in November 2014. I am still a fan of iPhone 5s, over newer 6 or 6s. It's much cheaper then iphone 6 and 6s, but with all the same features including fingerprint authentication and a powerful 64-Bit processor. If a bigger screen is not your priority then this is a good cheaper iPhone. Now the important Question: Is it original with India Warranty? Answer: YES. I bought it from 'Gadgets_Guru' seller. Took phone to Authorized Apple service center, and got it verified, It had valid 1 year warranty
+ Great phone for a decent price I searched a lot for a phone at this price range and finally took this phone for dad. Because it's Motorola. It's got a decent processor, nice touch, more than enough of 1GB RAM for normal usage. No lags at all. Good speakers and also a good voice quality. So, It's a nice phone for 1st time Android users. 2 months gone and no problems at all. Only drawback is camera. Other wise its a very decent phone. Don't hesitate to buy if camera doesn't bother you muc
- Highly Unsatisfied. Display not functioning. Is there any support from amazon? My phone's display went off all of sudden today, i am not eligible for return of product. My phone is still under warranty, please guide me with further proceedings.
- avoid Moto e 2 this product (motoe2)doesnot have access to battery(by the user,i mean).doesn't have slot for standard sim cards. i had to go to a mobile shop for cutting the sim. to place it again in your old mobile, u have to purchase sim adopters.! the insertion for sim in moto e2 is by the side, for which a band around the phone is to be removed.quite cumbersome. it doesn't give a detailed instruction pamphlet.the battery and cable getting heated up while charging. gave to amazon authorized centre B2Xin hyderabad. i had to go to them thrice ,20km. far away, climb two floors.(they don't respond to tel.calls atall.(three nos. given by them).now after getting the cell, back, the sim is going in but the phone is not working. the heating problem is still there.i have to go to B2x again .hell of a trouble.avoid this phone .another customer of B2x said he visited them 4 times for repairs.service centre of B3x in the city are only 3
- camera quality is very ok micro pics are way better than wide shots there are a few defects.. contact numbers don't get saved or shows that its saved but cant retrieve it.. most of the time u have to mute & then un-mute while on a call or the caller cant hear you. All the data is saved on the phone instead of the sd card so there is often storage space problem.camera quality is very ok micro pics are way better than wide shots. good battery life and very durable.
- Totally waste of money and bad experience. It was totally a bad experence. The phone is not working properly. It's lagging and camera is also having lots of issues. I contact customer care to replace it but they advise me to contact service center for any technical issue. I contact service center as well but they want me to leave for fifteen days. Totally waste of money.
- Camera is 5 mega pixel but its clarity is not good. before one month it gets switch off automatically its camera is 5 mega pixel but its clarity is not good. before one month it gets switch off automatically.
+ Good one. Thumbs up Even though the manufacturer markets the device to be a tablet and phone, I bought this device to be used exclusively as a tablet, mainly for reading. I was looking for a in expensive tablet with decent specs and full HD screen for a while. And also I was looking for something compact and easy to hold. In the world of tablets, cheap ones have poor screen and full HD and higher quality screens are very expensive. The devices that fit my budget and requirement were MiPad, Nexus 7 and this one. And I chose this one because it was the most compact among the three and easy to hold.
+ Good sound 4 This review was written after 5 days of using the mobile. 1. Big mobile. Slides into my shirt pocket (2/3 inside pocket, 1/3 remains visible above pocket). This was just to give an idea of the dimensions. 2. Smooth touch 3. Good sound 4. Battery: One day with Internet ON. 5. Big screen: I bought this mobile primarily for Internet (browser based). I'm quite satisfied using the browser in this mobile. If you do a lot of browser based job on the go, then it is worth a buy. 6. Speed: No lag found in applications. Internet speed is superb.
- Recommend not to buy Its not worth buying this product i bought it and returned on very next day as this lenovo phab plus does not have good screen the size of phab plus is good thats y i bought it but the software is does not run smooth.
- It is highly disappointing performance from lenovo I had a high hope on this phone but it is not value for money for the following reasons 1. Slow in response 2. Getting stuck frequently 3. The phone is getting restarting automatically 4. The voice clarity while attached to bluetooth is very poor
+ Excellent product. Excellent product.... Very nice display... A bit bigger to carry but isn't it a phablet? It fits into any comfirt jeans.... Very good for reading... Not heavy to carry..Overall very happy and satisfied with it...
- Really Sad. As a phone many features are not included for example, no file browser.... you need to install third party app. the biggest blunder is when u are in recent call list you cant write a text message to that number only call back function is there.... Alas, the music app lacks folder wise playing, mp3 player is just basic (feels like 2006) , if you install apps in your memory card, the Icons will disappear from your home screen in every restart....booo... there are lot of shortcomings while comparing with my old Samsung galaxy grand. I am terribly disappointed with this phab plus. I am feeling ashamed of my decision . Sorry Guys,,,,, unless Lenovo provide update for this phone. + Great Phone I've been using this phone for last 2 weeks. I would say this is one of the best devices that Lenono has launched.
+ Till now, my experience of watching movies, playing high end games is pretty good. I liked the Dolby surround sound feature. Experience of watching movies while this feature is ON is amazing.
- front camera is good back camera not good its not dual sim tuch front camera is good back camera not good its not dual sim tuch is not good sound is not good ok h phone design is very good but internal function very bad
- Don't get cheated!! Don't buy!! Please don't buy this product. It's hardly 2 weeks now and the WiFi has stopped functioning. It has only a 10 day return period and my 18000 bucks has just been stolen. Wat is the use of this phablet if the WiFi doesn't work. Feel Cheated thoroughly! Even the phone doesn't work properly!!
- 2 out of 5 starsPoor battery life. battery has discharge issues.
- ... have no response pls don't buy it is feels like a iron box don't buy Don't buy micromax product my tab getting very hot while charging and operating charging time its taken more then 4 hours but battery drains in standby half day only I buy the tab at poorvika and reporting this problem for seller and micromax service center and also I'm mailed micromax care I have no response pls don't buy it is feels like a iron box don't buy,don't buy,don't buy
- Bad product Don't go for it..I bought it 15 days back and today it stopped responding..it was a gift for my mum and today when she tried to switch it on it won't respond and a flash comes on the screen and the whole screen goes black . Such a waste of money and face . Do not go for it . Maybe they are selling second hand product
- Worst tab ever used bayyery drain Screen diaplay problem Charging ... Worst tab ever used bayyery drain Screen diaplay problem Charging pin doesn't work properly Hangs ..... Lots more
- Bad product. Returned it after using it for a ... Bad product. Returned it after using it for a few hours. There are a lot of preloaded junk apps that cannot be uninstalled. The gps keeps turning on its own due to the junk apps. The tab performance is very slow. Battery drains quickly and it has to be plugged in most of the time - defeats the purpose of being mobile device.
- the item is totally waste with in 6 month of purchase hardly 5 min ... the item is totally waste with in 6 month of purchase hardly 5 min backup required continuous supply of current the charger is not working front and back camera is useless I know the iBall is a good manufacturer but i don't know what happen to the company ???? I never advised any body to purchase this type of item
- Bad Experience with Iball Slide i701 Received a piece with charging problem. though it is a complete Windows 8.1, still touch functionality has issues with it. Power button has a major issue. sometimes it switches on sometimes not. No LED indications- One more major drawback. Whether the Tablet as ON or OFF can't have a clue. Battery though seems big capacity, really drains in 3-4 hrs. sound low on inbuilt speaker as well as earpieces, especially while we commute.
+ Nice tablet at low cost! I bought this tablet for 2900 and using it from about a month and it's fabulous. Built quality is good, looks really nice. It has windows 8.1 pre-installed which is upgradable to win 10. Internal memory is low so don't forget to put a micro sd card in it. Make default install location to sd card only. When upgrading to win 10,select sd card to install. Use light weight apps. It has otg support which works really well. 3 colorful back cases are free with it which are of good quality. Screenguard is pre-installed. A hdmi cable is also free with it. Viewing angles are not good. You have to sit in exact front of this to view properly. Not good if you're buying it just to watch movies. But overall a very good product and a light weight alternative to pc and laptop.
- 1 out of 5 starsPls dont buy!!!! Really waste product, waste of money. Dont buy it. Or else you'll keep it in Iball service center. The product worked fine till the end of amazon's replacement date. Now it is in service center from past 20 days, no reply from iball, Amazon slipped out of its responsibilities by telling that returning time is over. Now I think that I have wasted 4000rs by buying it.
+ Excellent for any laptop/windows users Excellent for any laptop/windows users. The price is very affordable for these specifications. Delivery was perfect. If you are expecting anything more than this for this price, don't go for this. First time windows users may find it difficult but very easy for computer/laptop users. I will definitely recommend this. Service issues I have not encountered so far.
+ Overall this tablet phone is good. I bought this mobile of Rs. 2999/- & I am a new user of this tab. After one month's standard using of this tablet, now I can say to all others customers that if U want to purchase a non voice calling tablet, U must buy this one. Battery is too good, browsing speed is enough, video & picture is good, camera & useful internal memory 4 gb out of 16 gb is not good. But under 3000/- I m very satisfied & I recommend to all amazon customers that U all would not disappoint so keep buying and be happy. Thank u.
+ Delivers more than the price May be a best choice at this most affordable price range. I have been using from last 5 months. No complaints so far. I bought it particularly for HDMI interface support that this tablet has. It works fine and connection to my Samsung TV did not give any problem. With addition of a wifi keyboard and mouse and i have a good enough working system as it is a windows pc. I agree display is bad, but for this price range that is ignorable. Very happy to purchase this..
+ Super iOS 8 update applied automatically to my iPad, but since then it has been crashing and restarting now and again, particularly sometimes when I'm using the (really excellent) Dolphin browser. Crashes once a day. This despite two quick iOS 8 updates... Still love the device, though.
+ Cannot think of anything better An excellent product... U will fall in love within a few minutes of use... A mind boggling screen, thanks to the retina display.... Highly recommended
+ Good laptop, but Ubuntu users beware! Good laptop, worth the price. Might have given 5 stars if the trackpad's buttons were better and the build felt more sturdy. Overall though, no real complaints about the quality considering it is a sub 25k laptop.   
+ 5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent Slim Powerpacked under 25k! Excellent Product If you are looking for a budget laptop with a decent configuration then Lenovo G50-80 is the right choice for you. The best thing which i liked about this product was it's battery backup(up to 4 hrs under normal use) and staying cool despite of using for hours. I would suggest for buying it.Good thing is in this laptop is 1tb hard disk,4 GB ram,2.0 ghz processor, 5th generation i3, excellent touch pad,Dolby Sound and very economic.   
- contact the Lenovo customer care response is not good. They were not solve the issue through online! Wireless is not working in the laptop , contact the Lenovo customer care response is not good .They were not solve the issue through online and waste my time. 5 to 6 times called to lenovo customer care they were put on hold my call up to 15 mints and response and they were not call back also. I am feed up with lenovo customer care people   
+ Experience is good and service center available in Bangalore! Value for money. We at our little start up have purchased 5 of these systems in a phased manner for our day to day work. Experience is good and service center available in Bangalore. Lenovo also respects warranty and does not charge for service if there are minor issues.   
+ very good laptop! Overall Very good laptop.good performance of every function.I am using this since January 2016 and not any single issue till now even availing warranty but for this u have to register your product with lenovo India by mailing invoice of product.   
+ One of the Finest Laptop under 25k. The only thing I don't like about the laptop is the Edge of the laptop is little bit wider. Best Configuration Laptop and M always a Fan of Lenovo.   
+ Nice Slip Laptop with awesome battery backup!  Nice Slip Laptop with awesome battery backup of 4-5 hrs ( with wifi usage ). Little hard to find drivers of Win8. Lap is compatible with only Win7 or Win10. I have installed Win8.1 with Win7 drivers. It is good. No lags. Even now I have opened 23 tabs in Google Chrome and Music is playing in background !!!! Nice product @ less price. It got it for 18500. But its market price is Rs.24500 in HP stores. If your're a casual user for using internet and watching movies, this is for you.   
+ Good service from Hp in replacing the crashed HDD Was a new laptop with a Crashed HDD.!  It didn't have an operating system hence we didn't know it was crashed untill we tried installing one on it. Asked HP if they could replace it for a new one and they said it wasn't possible as it has crossed 14days. Good service from Hp in replacing the crashed HDD.   
+ Decent laptop under 20k go for it..! If you are looking for a budget laptop with decent configuration, go for it. I was searching for a laptop with 20k budget, went through all the offerings on different websites and was surprised to see the price difference on Amazon! This laptop was 1000 INR cheaper on Amazon.   
+ its working fine..!I was purchased on two month before...its working fine...good look and performance also good.... But audio quality is low....   
+ Nice product...no scratches happens...perfectly fit..But only fault I found from my experience is bubble spreading...may be due to improperly fix by the shop guy without trying to check whether any bubble left or not...Price also slightly on the higher side. So many branded tempered glass for other mobiles priced less than Rs 200 with same specifications mentioned.....Will buy one more if priced around 200, as I need a tempered glass for my K3note with bubble free.    
+ Truly recommended.! This handset is amazing. Initially had doubt that it would hang time & again. But that isn't the case with 'Samsung J7'. This is an amazing masterpiece of samsung in an affordable price. Truly recommended.   
- Only good thing about this phone is a long battery life otherwise its really bloated with about 50 useless built in Asus apps which make the phone lag as if its 4yrs old. Anyhow, my phone suddenly died for no aparent reason after just 2 months, chasing with Asus about warranty, lets see how good they're with aftersales service. BUT Amazon's service delivery was great, no complaints for their service but I would highly discourage anyone to buy an Asus smartphone.   
+ Longlasting Asus Zenfone Max! The phone is extraordinary and battery is the highlight thing., Withstands more than 2 days with complete usage also and speed is good. Wanna phone under 10 k, please go ahead and purchase, The only disadvantage is that no headphones with it. Asus need to look into it.   
+ Good mobile! Awesome phone in this price segment. First of all there is no heating. Battery lasts 2 days on heavy use. Camera is good for normal day to day use. No hanging problem till now .I am using this phone for 2 months now. Only cons is that it is heavy. I guess its weight is more than 200guns. Whereas Samsung galaxy s4 is 130 gms. I have no complaints.   
- Useless! One of the worst phone I have ever used.   
+ 5.0 out of 5 starsDON'T LISTEN NEGATIVE FEEDBACK WALA .............. THE PHONE IS PERFECT........... TRUST ME !  
+ 4.0 out of 5 starsLooks really good, metal finish and everything!  Bought this as soon as it came out.. Looks really good, metal finish and everything. got the additional stylus as well which according to me was a little over priced but worth spending money on, helps you out in more ways than you can imagine. the specifications are fine. Simcard Slot provided is god sent, so much better than carrying a dongle around. The keyboard attached provides stability along with the ability to use the devices in different modes and is far better than the soft keyboards provided with other 2 in 1's. Can be used in different modes. It also came with sufficient ports to fulfil all needs & requirement. A perfect buy if you plan on using it as tablet and as a full powered PC.   
+ Showstopper! If you are thinking the price is worth or not..let me tell you it definitely is! It is not a tablet. It is a proper full fledged laptop which is also a tablet. Desktop softwares and apps both work flawlessly. External hdd, cd drive, external display, SD card all work! Also it is has a pencil which beats all the styluses before. Its a future of all laptops.   
- NOT GOOD! Picture quality is not good. Sound is very poor. Not satisfied with this laptop.   
- screen display quality very bad. graphics quality! HD movie Does not Support . screen display quality very bad. graphics quality poor.   
+ best sell....! Good option for 20000 rs!! I'm excited.   
- 2.0 out of 5 starslooks and feel is good. but many problems in use! looks and feel is good. but many problems in use. Store is not opening so i am not able to make window update. accessing google website is really painful. keeps getting security warning. This system does not work work as notebook or laptop but just a tablet with keyboard. not happy going to return.   
+ SATISFIED! Very good laptop for basic work ( Net browsing, Microsoft office applications), easy to carry around light weight. professional look with nice colours. good battery backup. It is suitable for everyone. It is very helpful for me for my work. Affordable price within my budget. It got Windows 10. Nice touch pad and keyboard like a high end laptop. Satisfied with the product. thank u amazon.in and Asus. Best laptop at this price.    
+ Good product, nice battery life! Good product, nice battery life, hang sometimes but value for money.don't expect a hi fi machine in 15K. Looks r really good. Slim design.    
- Fake Lightening deal product.! I made this purchase on lightning deal and product shown 27K as normal price and deal price is 25K. But immediate next day when I have seen selling price it has shown Rs.25916. In this case it is not real deal. Be aware of these deals.

+ Five Stars! Great product. Great price. The product is Win10 by default and not Win8 as mentioned currently   
+ Lean Mean Machine! Beautiful elegant swift !! 3 words to describe how efficient this machine is with cloid storage enabled there's no limit to what you can do with this netbook   
+ Awesome is the word it suits best! Awesome is the word it suits best.. don't complain abt harddisk. .. If u need go with other products.... silent operation is the key feature.. no heating problem.. I used for long periods like 8 hours or so.. I encountered a little heat.. so no problem.. windows 10 is icing on cake in this little guy.. I am very happy

- I Bought Asus Eebook X205TA-FD0061TS 11.6 inch laptop dark blue for Rs 14989 and the item reached my house on 16/2/16 .I only used for 2 days and it is stopped functioning and it is not opening and i wanted to return back but the period is over and hence ihave lost that money.Hence forth i will think twice to buy from Amazon.I feel if i had put little more money i could have bought from open market directly eye to eye.There will be one consolation that we have seen the item and then bought.Friends be careful   
- What a ride from Amazon/Dell ! Dell Inspiron 3551, delivered on 01 Nov 15. Got the software loaded and got it functional on 04 Nov. It goes TOTALLY DEAD on 11 Nov15 one day after it is out of Return/Replace policy deadline.Now have to suck upto the whims and fancies of the Dell Service Centre in Pune !   
+ SATISFYING PERFORMANCE! Overall satisfying performance. I am able to run AutoCAD,CATIA,hyperworks softwares.battery backup actually very good It can run up to 6 hours in single charge.good for professional and daily use. Windows 8.1 take 60-70 seconds for become ready to use.Touchpad quality is kind of poor.but touch sensitivity is good. It doesn't have CD-DRIVE, LAN port &19 pin video output port.Still no big deal. But got HDMI port. Gaming is ok it got about 2000mb internal graphics. That's it.   
- Box of Asus and upper surface of laptop was very old seem like the laptop was returned from number of customer.   
- No happy   
- Zero Stars! This thing abruptly stopped working after one week of usage. Won't charge and when I connect it to AC it doesn't go beyond the lockscreen. Please do not waste your money on this terrible netbook. This was my first and last purchase from Micromax!   
- Looks nice. But thats about it! Dont buy. Looks nice. But thats about it. I am struggling with the return. No one bothers to listen at the service centres. Track pad does not work.. Keys are malfunctioning... and micromax aint responding to emails or calls. Quite Gawaar the call center folks there. Over all, micromax is pathetic. got a tab too...that too was very cheap... thankfully returned it to amazon within the return time frame. This one I am stuck with.   
- Shitty service. Warranty just for show. No use.! My charger stopped working and I can't find a replacement for this lapbook.   
+ Short and sweet.! It's a mini package of happiness.. It has got all the features equal to a Basic laptop..It's a gem for browsing the internet,watching movies,listening to songs..The speakers are very nice..It's a must buy for basic users and people who are looking for a low priced laptop..I'm happy for buying it...and thanq Amazon for in time delivery.   
- Faulty WiFi Adapter/Port but Saved by Amazon! The laptop would have been an excellent purchase had the WiFi not have stopped working within a month of the purchase. I was luckily saved by Amazon who helped me with scheduling a return and providing a refund. Kudos to Amazon but I find it ridiculous that a laptop in this day and age gets spoilt 3 weeks after purchase! Come on Asus you can do better with quality control! Speed is average, what you should expect paying INR 15,000 for a laptop - open up a couple or more tabs on Chrome and the device slows down drastically and you can begin to see the lag. The touchpad is definitely one of the biggest positives of the laptop. Screen is average but then again, it goes back to the price point.   
+ Love it and hope to use it for a long time! It's very compact. Very easy to use. It feels as if I am carrying a note book. There no need to keep a table or support while working on it by keeping on my lap. Windows 10 is very good. Had WiFi connectivity problem after upgrade but got resolved biggg thanks to you tube angels. Battery lasts very long as promised. Hardly needs to be charged once in a week for my usage level 1 to 2 hours daily.   
- Don't bay this one ...start problem from first day   
- 1.0 out of 5 starsStupid Purchase - Defective Product - No Support for Online Purchase!. Two of the four notebooks I purchased were defective pieces. The system was hanging on boot. The problem with online purchase was that the service delears were not prepared to accept for service citing online purchase. While I able to return on the notebooks, the other is lying with me and I am not sure what to do with the system. It is extremely dicey to buy this Asus product on the net. The rates look attractive, but please think a thousand times before clicking on the purchase button.     
- Product is good, but nearly rs 1000/- different from flipcart for same product. Why so different   
- Don't buy! I have bought this laptop 6 months back in Feb. It was working nicely. Then its keyboard stopped working after only 3 months of use. And for last 2 months Asus is unable to repair it. So please don't buy its a gamble. Asus service is very poor.   
- Pathetic quality.! Please dont buy this. I have been using this for 4 months now. Doesnt charge properly after 2 months. The connection between tab and keyboard keeps breaking. The service centre doesnt respond and keeps you on hold for 15 mins at times. The screen stops responding in between. Pathetic quality.   
+ Too good for too less.! Product is really good. Server the purpose of both Laptop & Tablet, But Keyboard unit is quite bulky. This is a mobile unit so dont expect much for heavy applications, but way good for daily normal works. Camera is not good, but camera in Laptop is just for Video Call. Amazon delivers the product just-in-time. Cost effective in 20K. I am just hoping for good performance.   
- very bad product... im highly disappointed with it. poor battery charging as well.   
- Didnt use for close to month and half .... and then i open it one fine day....the laptop wont boot up or charge. having given it to the service center for repair.. fingers crossed.   
- It Sucks..! Very Poor Product.. Quite heavier and Sound very very low, Display angle pathetic. Camera, Performance everything sucks.!! Unreasonable at this price.. Returned it the next day,..!!   
- Horrible combination of Notebook and Tablet! Purchased in the first week of June'15. Stopped working (Charging not taking place) within 3 weeks. Submitted to Acer Service Centre. After 2 weeks, rectified product given back back by Service Center but again multiple problems started. During recitification, Motherboard was replaced but it seems to be about 1 yr. old Motherboard. Now the tablet stops when any external device (hard disk, DVD drive) are plugged into USB port. Micro SD card slot is not detecting memory card, Power indicating LED not functioning, at lower battery, camera is shutting down the entire system. Presently, equipment is still in the service centre for the last 2 weeks. The product has been launched without quality checks. Beware of this type of procuts.   
- it is a 2gb ram laptop. SEller has wrongly mentioned 8 GB ram. After talking to CC also it is still showing the same 8 GB ram. REally NONSENSE!!   
- cheap trick let to buying this product! product was not as per specification it was not 8gb as mentioned earlier. it was 2gb. do not buy i can see the description corrected now but advise not to buy   
- wrong description of products! Description showed 8GB RAM laptop but product delivered was with 2GB RAM. Disappointed. Wasted time.   
+ Sir if u pucrchage this laptop maybe flipcart best option! 4star for laptop & performance. 3Star for laptop without Window & required min window 8. I m shock Amazon provide me driver cd faulty & old condtin, . 1 Star for Amazon caurier srevice. Sir if u pucrchage this laptop maybe flipcart best option.   
+ worth buying if u look for small laptop go for it! Good laptop,500gb hard disk. No promblem on one month usage battery back up to 5hours .   
- 1 star! Bluethooth and wifi is not working properly.   
+ Good product for daily home usage! A good product with the price range mentioned. Everything is working fine me: the keyboard, the wifi, blue tooth, LAN, audio output, the camera. Boot time is really fast (mine is Win 10). Start to window screen within 12 sec. You have to update the bios if you are trying to install from bootable usb.   
- Battery and RAM are not easily accessible. ASUS has been miser by not providing LED for caps lock, wifi, blue tooth, nor any key combination for these e.g., function+ key#. However, these are acceptable if you consider the quality of the product and the price.   
- I am not satified your laptop itam! Guide book not avalable with leptop frist installation & process not avalable so please provide guide book and process in written   
- Please dont buy it. Very slow system and processor. I'm stuck with it now but dont want others to face the disappointment. Very very slow using win*. I will check with windows 7 now. Real bad experience   
+ Very good at this price point Only issue is with wlan driver. I tried my level best but couldn't install the wlan. So got it done from a local computer expert and start using the lappy.   
+ good product! It's a nice laptop. Display is good , No lag,good battery backup. Overall i m satisfied. Need to upgrade RAM to 4gb for good performance if you use win7 64 bit OS.   
- waste of time! its a waste laptop that i revised from amazon, its not getting booted.. it showing blue screen, i tryed to load win 7, and i found a spot in the display pls return my laptop.   
- Too slow in processing! I have buy this Laptop in Oct 2014. This the processing is very slow in this laptop because of windows 8 and RAM is only 2GB. RAM should be at least 4 GB. We can not add more RAM because there is only one slot of RAM. Even company provide Drivers for windows XP and Windows 7. Not satisfied wit this.   
- not good! This not good suddenly hang up in laptop.   
- Fake Lightening deal product! The configuration looks Okay. But the price and goodies which we receive with it are not worthy. Only we receive Laptop, Battery and charger. if you spend 25K for the same piece out side market we could get few free goodies (Backpack, Key Guard, Screen Guard and normal optical mouse) along with the software installation. Here spending 25K for only laptop is not good deal.I felt I was looted and not recommend to buy this kind of products in online shopping.   
+ amazing phone which will certainly make smile on ur face...just out standing full paisa wasool..bought in this month   
- not a great phone. lots of bloatware. noticeable lag while switching between the applications. phone gets heated while playing games. RAM utilization is not great. think before buying this product.   
+ quick delivery - v good looks and quick performance till now - no lags, camera slightly above average, looks - killer overall nice package for a budget phone.   
+ I was confused between honor lenovo k4 and letv 1ss. But finally I orderedhonor, trusting it and I am very happy with my decision now. Amazon.. Amazing service! I appreciate your work. Golden is better than silver n grey.   
+ Master of all budgeted smart phone! worth every penny. samsung is looting money. I wud like to see the downfall of samsung like Nokia. coming to this Phone,- its phenomenal, finger scanner is so fast, nice camera, navigation is smooth. i recommend this mobile.   
- Phone doesn't support quick charge.....tried with multiple fast chargers but all in vein......phone takes almost 4 hours to charge 100% Also earpiece volume is too low for outdoor conditions If you can cope up with these issues then phone is awesome.   
+ I was looking for a premium budget oriented cell phone. Finally the search is over now. Itz been more than 20 days now and this phone is working well in day to day usage. Batter life: Decent (Good) (Using Dual Sim on 3g/4G for whole day) Screen quality/ outdoor visibility: Good Camera: Good Call quality: Good GPS Navigation: Good Overheating: Not at all (it heats up a little bit after using GPS for more than 1 hour continuously) Gamming: Good Audio recording: not that much great as it compress the audio level a lot (obviously not great like an iPhone or Motorola handset/ Nokia) Video: Good Overall look and feel is great after few tweaks the UI works very smoothly.   
+ I have been using this beast since 2 days now, the battery lasted for 15 hours on a medium usage, the display is amazing and so is the fingerprint sensor.Highly recommend for gamers and photo enthusiastic people.   
- The phone heated up as soon as I unpacked and connected to WiFi to configure the phone. Stock phone has 800MB available memory as against 1.2GB which you see in other similar phones. Multiple apps running in the background heats up the phone like crazy. Not at all recommended! Above all Amazon policy of no return sucks.    
+ A great buy!!! I bought the Honor 5X after missing out on buying the Le1S. I didn't want to waste my time with another flash sale so opted for my second best option - the Honor 5X. I am glad I bought it. I am not a techie and I don't play games. I am not going to go into features which have already been spoken about here by umpteen people. I use the phone primarily to surf the internet and communicate. This phone fulfils all my functions and more. I absolutely love the fingerprint scanner. It unlocks my phone ten out of ten times. There is absolutely no lag and it is a very superior feature at this price point. The home screen is a little dull and does not have the liveliness of the typical Android home screens. It gets a little bit of getting used to, but it more than makes up with dozens of features tucked away within it. The rear camera is excellent and is perfect in good lighting conditions. In dull or low light, it struggles a lot and images look grainy. Same with the front camera. I love all the features that come with the camera. This mobile is a beast, and I love the ease and speed of opening and operating multiple applications. The price is the most attractive aspect of this phone. I also find the battery life of the phone very encouraging. It easily lasts a full day inspite of heavy usage. I have always bought my mobiles after physically inspecting it in the real world. This is the first time I bought it online. I have absolutely no regrets. This is a great phone and Huawei have tested this phone very well. A week into using the phone and I am loving the experience very much.   
+ Fantastic Experience! Overall 5 * everything is very good. Display is very fine, smooth touch, good backup, call quality is good 4g experience is also fantastic, speed is so fast, no hang. But camera is not high rated its average. Its best in 15 k range... its my 8th smartfone and first phone which satisfy me 90% Buit is also fabulous metalic and gold look gives it 5 star. But accessories like temper glass and back cover are not in market. One thing is very bad .. that is packaging of phone by seller is very bulky and low quality.   
+ This phone is very best because in this phone all parts of good! This phone is very best because in this phone all parts of good........! Front & back camera or led flash light is excellent I have used this mobile phone!

Royal looking, Robust built. Lacks OTG, Gorilla Glass, Feels Slippy. I have used Huawei Ascend G700 earlier for two years and its performance was very good.   
+ Phone is perfect for this price range.I am writing after 1 week of use. Phone is perfect for this price range. No hitting and lagging issues. Battery life is more than expected (2 days in normal use). Fingerprint is accurate. Everything is perfect enjoying it.

+ The service was very good.The delivery was as expected.And about mobile....hats offfff.....The battery backup is really good.New and improved features and the camera of the mobile....no words.   
- Product is not genius. Found samsung seal broken while opening package. Found custom rom in status on mobile. Charger is durty.   
- Please do not buy this mobile. 4G will not work properly and this is the feedback given by Samsung Service center and and Samsung doenst have any solution for this as of now. Ring tone volume is very less I am suffering because of Samsung.

IT HAS PERFECT BALANCED PROCESSOR AND RAM AND BATTERY AND SCREEN AND CAMERA BEST IN PRICE GO FOR IT .............. HERE THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK WALA ARE SENSELESS PERSON THEY R FAKE USER,,,, OF OTHER COMPANIESS MOBILE USERSSSSSSS   
- mobile is not good to see.....but very bad service of amazon....next time i m not perchase from amazon.   
- Bad GPS, Lousy predictive text - but a very long lasting battery! Spellcheck / predictive test is horrible - it corrects even when you are typing names in dialing a contact. GPS - is very weak and slow Battery is excellent - Multi language data input is excellent Speakers volume is very low.   
- I wish I could also give 5 * to ASUS max... Had purchased it just 3 days back, mainly for amazing review about battery..... disappointed. battery is draining every minute ..... just comes down to 50% with minimal usage..... I had been earlier using ASUS.... m v dissatisfied. My suggestion don't buy....   
- 1.0 out of 5 starsNot satisfied.! The screen is delicate and before putting itself it broke. Disappointed. You can buy directly in a shop and get it done. Even the package looked like opened earlier.   
- It looks like plastic I wasted my! S*** product .....just after 2days glass is faded. It looks like plastic I wasted my money   
- Worst product for ever!! Full of bubbles and not stick properly.So many bubbles even apply as professional person. Glass cutting is not good. Very disappointing to buy this glass. Also glass all side are not stick properly on phone surface so do not buy and invest in good product.   
- Glass attract dust and fingerprint like regular glass or even moreFirst of all its edge its not curved.! Glass attract dust and fingerprint like regular glass or even more.it need cleening with cloth after every use.9H hardness or not only time will tell.glass already had one scratch and didn't look like new.although packeting was new , the way product was shield inside the foso packet any one can tampered it without trace of opening it. Although its fits perfectly one phone, still I am very disappointed with the quality of the product and advice not to purchase it.this glass not worth rs 300.   
- Arrived with scrathes.!The package had everything listed. Unfortunately the tempered glass had scratches on the left and right side. Not satisfied.   
+ Its Really Gr8! It works fine and offers ample protection... The only thing I noticed is tht "Double Tap To Wake" sometimes doesn't work properly.It sometimes takes more than two taps... Apart from tht it works like a charm and won't be a hindrance when it comes to day to day use.. I'll happily recommend it to anyone using a K3 Note.   
+ The tampered glass is of very good quality and the same was emphasised from one of the mobile seller from whom I got it installed. I still would suggest the buyer to install it from a nearby mobile shop, rather than by doing by himself as suggested by the brand. Definitely worth buying.   
+ This is a really good product. Its almost everything they claim to be! This is a really good product. Its almost everything they claim to be. Good finish and pretty perfect fit on the screen. The touch is as good as it was before the installation of the screen guard. The display got much clearer than what it was with the standard screen guard i have been using. Lenovo K3 note is known for its really good diplay, and i feel that a screen guard like this brings out the full potential of that. The slots are almost a perfect fit. Overall i like this product and i must admit that it is indeed everything what i expected it to be. But its not completely oleophobic. But it doesn't mean that it is an oil magnet either. It keeps off oil smudges to an extent, but not completely. But its very easy to wipe it off, which is a welcome improvement from the one I was using before. So in a nutshell, except for this minor problem, if that can be called a problem at all, I am completely satisfied with the product. As the lenovo k3 does not have a scratch resistant screen you will need a screen guard anyway. From my experience, I recommend this product from the many similar ones available. And as always the service from amazon was of top quality, especially the way they packed the product.   
+ Best product. Go for it I ordered this product as usual amazon delivered before time and felt very happy abt this product its worth paying the money bccaz its does what is says...doesn't fits completely but its good bcaz the glue won't dries off and covers the required screen its a real glass and antifinger mark vgood clearity and won't disturbs the sensors at all guys packing is OK wanna buy go for it.   
+ Complete product at a value price! I have bought 535 for my father after 540 for myself. 535 is a complete device. it has everything once needs to be productive on the go. Some sites say about touch issues. But after taking the demo and using it for more than 1 month, I can say that this is as smooth as 540. It is easy to carry, has long battery life, has a nice screen with good audio quality. Also it will get Windows 10 update in future, so it will be good deal considering the future. Anyway now we have 2 Lumias in our home and we are happy with it. There is no hanging or freezing problems, no overheating and the battery life is good. As for software part, most of the apps are preloaded like Facebook, Skype, twiter etc for social networking, one note, office etc for productivity. Some essential apps like whatsapp, viber etc are easily available and cab be set up easily.   
- Lot of problems with phone. So many times touch goes haywire. Something is tapped & something different starts. Some software bugs as well. Phone received was used one but as I had already gotten replaced a defective phone once before I will keep this one.   
- Not good for premium brand phone users..! The worst part of the phone is battery back up... Hardly lasts for 4-5 hours when the full functionality(whatsapp, synching e-mail accounts etc) of the phone is turned on.... Probably the battery would last even less time if internet browsing is done....On the contrary if it is just used as a Nokia 1100 phone (i.e by switching off internet, Whatsapp, e-mail synching etc) then the battery lasts for about 24 hours... Also there is heating problem... Upper part of the phone gets heated too soon.   
- Microsoft needs lot of improvement, I ordered this phone with lot of expectations but let me project the real picture here: touch is really pathetic even worse than 4-5k Chinese phones. Had lot of bugs in application like gallery back button disappeared when you open any picture. screen display quality is really poor. overall please ignore this phone. compare to this in same price range Samsung j2 is better option.   
- LCD Touch scree pathetic quality..please never buy lumia phone...this is one the worst phone i have ever experienced..i have kept phone in my pocket and LCD Screen broken..i have found low quality of Touch screen..after that i contact to service center they replied me it was your fault and its cost is 2950..means half of the price of mobile.   
- Phone was not working properly. I don't know where to complain.. Phone getting hanged and getting more heat while using internet. Don't buy from this supplier. I would suggest to buy in official show room. So that we can claim any issues. Even though I paid VAT along with the bill..no use.   
- Unsatisfy!There was an issue with the internet connectivity. I visited Nokia gallery to resolve the issue. They updated the mobile software and now its working. However, being a new mobile phone such problems should not occur. I will be more cautious while ordering anything online.   
- It's worst to experience this phone. in just period of 2 months time it is getting hang and touch is also not working properly. while visited the service center they simply say update the software and done nothing else. I am disappointed with this phone and simply wasted my money.   
- dont ever buy the microsoft product from amazon! poorest sound quality and the speakers stop working in 1 day after buying the phone They replace with a used and not at all good product and for replacement there is no such things as easy return on Amazon it's a pain in ass.   
- Subse bekar phone as compared to Android phone.very very less application as compared to Android phone...... Or touch screen always break without any pressure or falling on surface....... The cost of touch screen is?2520.   
- not worth your hard earned money! not worth buying ordered twice didn't receive a single device which was ok.. both had dead pixels in the screen, and the touch was horrible even after updating with the fix which microsoft provided to fix the touch issue.   
- dont waste of money......check other smartphone..! yesterday i got it mobile after one day complete using lot of issue facing when i connect data cable with pc mobile hanging issue even when mobile connect charger facing hanging issue sometime keypad not work .   
- very worst phone Lumia. and amazon shoping.! I bought Lumia 535. Problem old packing, and after 2 days phone hangings automatic screen zoom touch problem, phone. Quality very poor and 3rd class type of maal. My total money wastage. I want crying......with amozon.   
- starsDont buy Microsoft products.! No because in one week the display got a crack without any reason and wen I took the phone to the Microsoft gallery they said display is not covered under the warranty and u have to shell out Rs 3.5 K for the same.   
- I am very much disappointed.! One week before I buy this from amazone, the major problem is that at the time of calling even after 3 min it will extreamly hot, i can not talk to any body. I will give it service center. I am very much disappointed.   
- 1.0 out of 5 starsThe phone is good battery life wise! The phone is good battery life wise. However, it has multiple display problems.. Most of the time screen hangs. Windows Store apps are very poor as compared to android. Touch is little less responsive.   
- this is the one damn worst mobile I'm using right now! I strongly recommend to one and all not to buy this damn mobile. Waste quality touch, heats alot, if one having a sweaty hand its very difficult to operate this product. 1905mAH lithium-ion battery providing talk-time of 11 hours is fake, it'll only get upto 2-3 hours max, if you are on Wi-Fi it actually dies soon. Even I admire the design of this product, but the back panel is a cheap quality one. Yes! It has a good futures like inbuilt memory, ram everything is fine and but touch is the worst part in this product, if one tries to mark a sentence for copying or tries to move cursor its a headache. Finally, I'm not trying to support windows or android but windows will not support some applications.   
- touchpad is not good and broke after two days!  touchpad is not good and broke after two days. i spent 2000rs within a wee on this. i am using samsung s duos from 2 years which is very good compared to this phone.   
- BAD SCREEN TOUCH EXPERIENCE ,IT ALSO FAIL SCREEN TOUCH TEST. INCONVEINENT TO USE IN RAINY OR WET WEATHER SEASON .TOUCH DOES NOT WORK WHEN CONTACT WITH MOISTURE..   
- The touch of the screen is not smooth and sensitive but is very hard The user manual and booklet is missing the handsfree is old and in used condition.   
- Lumia is not like android phone Not user friendly, no vlc player no youtube app no tv app and many more missing waste of money.   
- i have been trying to download applications and games from the STORE for 8 hours. i even created my microsoft and outlook account. nothing is working. NO app is getting downloaded either it gives 800c0005 error or gets stuck on DOWNLOADING for hours i also did RESET the phone. nothing is working planning to return this phone.   
- Guys, just stay away from purchasing any mobiles from Microsoft because their service is not at all customer friendly. The moments you give a product for any faults they will without doubt blame it on your handling and make you pay heavily very unlike of Nokia service centers. I have been the victim twice.   
- Microsoft is a big name. They have launched Lumia 535 with few great feature. But still the phone bought only disappointment of customer. I feel there is lot to do in "touch issue" of phone. Although few fallacies has been sort out through updates. The battery backup is also not that good. Good part is gorilla glass and speed of phone. The touch performance even after update is so poor that I had to buy new phone. Don't recommend as of now.   
- Very Bad Experience -Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, 8GB)! This Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, 8GB) really disgusting and very very bad experience for me in my life. I ordered this phone on 12th feb and after 10 days this phone had many problems ,Like a Phone Speaker does not worked, Heat problem, back cover is loose. i cannot believe what the hell is it And i tried to contact amazon customer service and they also giving me excuses etc. they pick my call and said sir we can't anything etc bcz return policy is over. Please don't buy this product, i already wasted my money . its looks but after used i know wht the hell is it.   
- Not a good experiance.It seems they always sell defective handsets online.From the day one i started using this handset,it was getting very hot even i used for a 10/15 seconds.I have to charge my battery twice in a day.Few days back it got completely dead.When i went to their service center i was told that it was liquid damage.I really dont know the reason.So far i used samsung smartphones and still using,but never had this type of problem.Personally i thought this type of electronic goods U should never by online.   
- Good phone, good battery, but not happy. Camera without zoom is just irritating. Makes you realize every time you use the camera that there were better options. Second biggest drawback is 'app store'. You will hardly get any updated version of useful apps. Even could not download app like 'truecaller' though it is there in store. Apps look very dull. It is a good phone for someone who has never used any smartphone (especially Android) or for them whose use of phone have been limited to 'green' button and 'red button'.   
- Very complex settings. Always there is issue in uploading and downloading of files. Photos are not getting uploaded in Facebook. Internet browsing is very slow i don't understand it has a quadcore or single core processor. Where as the same internet connection browsing, downloading is too fast in my other mobile (Lenovo a369i which has dual core). Except look, design, selfie camera other functions are not good. Come to know why lumia phones let down Nokia. Please guys go for android mobiles for their simplicity in operation. Within one less than one month use i am not happy with this mobile.   
- BT when I got mobile I was faced some problem....touch is not working when connected to charger and there was some mic problem..am talking loudly BT then also my voice is not listen by other person so big problem is this... Otherwise I recommended to all of u..nice phone go fr it.. Everyone can't face this problems..some like me only.. BT I appreciate policy of amzaone..that's y I always buy product from Amazone...   
- Its a crap dear! Completely unsatisfactory product. After update of windows 10 performance lags. Not so user friendly like Android phones. Screen resolution not good. Windows store is a crap. Nothing is available. Even amazon app not functioning in this phone. Slow functioning.I don't know how other people liked it who used Android phones. I also purchased for taste change but its bogus. Moreover it gets heated very easily and battery drains fast. What else?? It's a crap. Only one positive thing its live tiles on home screen. Think thrice before purchase. Thanks.   
- Microsoft Lumia 535 with 5" display and of low price makes fool everyone if u buy this bcoz its main major problem touch function-for every app or option u have to tap 2-3 times for opening.....zooming is not while taking pictures-this is another rediculous thing in this phone bcoz ordinary vga cam phones giving zoom option.......another strange factor is the music pauses suddenly middle of the song playing-i dont know y it happens?......"THINK BEFORE U BUY"   
- It is not good as per expectations Touch screen is not goood Mobile is switched off sometimes automatically Sensitivity is so complicated.   
- The product that was sent seems to be a used one. The date was Dec 2014. The box was old. Bsttery charge does not stay long. Drains very fast, may be used battery. I went to a nearby retail mobile shop. They had a brand new set of Feb 2015. Price was not too different may be RS. 300 extra. But better quality, latest updated OS and they provide free screen guard at the retail shop as well as 8 GB memory card. All in all a bad experience.   
- its been a couple of month now since I've bought this phone.Earlier i was using Android phone i thought of exploring a windows phone as i had never used it.I thought of buying this windows phone but probably i made a big mistake of choosing Microsoft windows phone.Being a user of both windows and android phone i will suggest anyone to go for android coz alot more features are available on android phone.very less app are available in windows store and that too,many of them does not respond properly. Android phone is strongly recommended to app freak people.The only thing i liked about this phone is performancewise(I have rarely seen my phone hanging) its way better than android.   
- I have a problem with the mobile, every 1 hour it is getting switched off...so irritating.   
+ I bought this phone for my cousin. His old android gave some problem also plan to switch windows phone. few of my friend, I referred this windows phone. all are happy with this model phone. He is not addict with Google Play store and download unnecessary crap app. Most Chinese crap phones are selling with same price. He used for mainly communication related apps. he is leaving to hyderebad for job on 5th Sep. Local market have same model with high price. I ordered this phone on amazon with one day delivery option. I ordered on 2 Sep night. promptly delivered on 4th Sep 6.30 PM. delivered content by simple cover not cardboard box this is one issue. I bought many clothes and shoes, this items are pack with sealed air cover with heavy card board box, but this phone pack with simple polythene cover. I don't know what to say. Phone is very good, very user friendly, Professional finishing not like Chinese crap phone. IPS Display and Good Resolution, Front and Back cameras are excellent. My cousin was happy and satisfied. when transfer some content via bluetooth it's automaticaly restart this is not major issue, then I update it this phone, some files are updated automatically. then problem is solved.   
+ Though I haven't bought it from amazon.in after 1 week of usage I will say this phone is excellent in terms of look, no touch related issues ( Because Denim Update is now available) no heating problem , battery very good ( U can use it for almost 2 days after full charge ) camera is excellent (Front Camera is too good) If u r bored with anroid os and planning to buy a device around 8k price range go for it ....   
+ I ordered this product fro Cloudtail. Got the delivery on time. The product is genuine, Showing 1 year warranty on apple website. The phone is extreme fast, very responsive, excellent performance. I am a android user but after using this phone with full load i found apple way far better than any Android phone. Go for it but purchase from high rated seller only. Cloudtail is most trusted.   
+ Apple will not disappoint you. look and feel of the phone is ...! order phone from cloud tail .....take a little time (5 days) to deliver. product is genuine .. Apple will not disappoint you.look and feel of the phone is just awesome ..3D touch is a new feature which is great for some users .   
+ Awesome phone and pretty color.. Rose gold.. I just loved it. Thank you amazon for original product guarantee...   
+ This is the best smartphone in the market. People who are rating 1 to 3 star are people who actually done even have the iPhone in their hands. It's not Apple's fault that the prices are too high. It's the government taxes that make the prices this high. Secondly, Amazon should only let people who have bought the product review the product as most of the reviews are useless as you need to review the product not the price of it and if you don't possess the product you shouldn't review it at all.   
+ Yes it is a good genuine product.   
+ It's really fabulous.discount is more enough to buy.its purely packed piece with all accessories real and original.   
+ Good & fast delivery. I love this product and thanks to amazon to give the reasonable price to me.   
+ I  have been using this phone for more than 2 months now and I am thoroughly satisfied . Amazon delivered the phone before time & in perfect condition . Thank you Amazon for the good service . The display , camera quality & the features of the phone are quite attractive .   
+ starsBest budget Windows Phone! Decent Phone.. Windows lovers & looking for a budget phone go for it.. Camera Quality is good. downloaded apps are running smoothly..   
+ Very good phone... Gifted to dad. He is very happy and its user friendly.   
+ Got it as a replacement for Dads phone. works good. no lag and good build quality I just wish microsoft would not turn on so much settings that breach privacy by default. Have to go in to custom install and turn off all. And requests location for even the smallest apps to run. weird Also doesnt seem like gorilla glass. but for the price cant complain i guess.   
+ Excellent   
+ .i buy this near shop kochi for 8900 rs . it my first windows Phone and also good . .nice very nice one from microsoft ! 5 mp camera cool , 1 gb ram , windows 8.1 everything super . but 8 GB internal memory not have to use , just near 4 gb . and some time lite (not over) heat up . otherwise good .i buy this near shop kochi for 8900 rs . it my first windows Phone and also good .   
+ excellent phone at good price.   
+ Outstanding phone. The best smartphone for this low price. Nice and thin, pretty smooth touch experience. It certainly worthy for the price.   
+ Worth your money! I like it's design and believe me I also liked lumia 8.1 denim update. It is very much pleasing to the eye. Not a perfect phone, but at this price this is too good. You will not be disappointed. Recommended strongly.   
+ A dual SIM handset can be used to a number of advantages. Likewise my new Microsoft Lumia 535 smartphone with dual SIM support helps me save money on calls and data and also lets me manage my contacts in a more organized way. Apart from this the handset is a true smartphone with a range of features like the Skype, MS Office, One Note, X Box and OneDrive. Also clicking selfies on the 5 MP front camera is easy. Its wide angle capture makes the images much wider. This same feature also comes to use during the Skype video calls as well. The handset looks gorgeous with the colourful cover and the big 5 inches IPS LCD screen.   
+ The Microsoft Lumia 535 is the handset I have been waiting for. It is within my budget and has all the features that I wanted on it. It has great 5 MP front camera for selfies and it also came with wide angle lens so that the selfies I click are wider and has a bigger portion of the background within the frame. The handset also allows high quality Skype video calls. The 5 inches IPS LCD screen is apt for such features. The functioning of the handset is smooth and doesnt get stuck midway. Thanks to its quad core processor and the 1 GB RAM   
+ Amazing phone at a 9k price range.Windows usage might be a bit different and the phone looks a bit brittle and colors look different than shown in pics.Overall not a bad phone at this price.Please dont expect an iphone experience.I strongly recommend this product considering the budget.   
+ very good   
+ Best Mobile in this price range.... Simply Love it Camera's great Music's great The set is great!!!!!   
+ Awasome Phone Ever Great Phone Which i need Now My Dream Becomes True My First Mobile Phone Which i Buy With My Money.   
+ Super...awesome   
+ Lumia 535 DS has all the features any normal user would expect. Phone display, resolution, IPS screen, touch quality, camera (front & primary with flash) are very good. .Affordable and has all the feature that a phone costing over Rs 20000/-.Value for money. However this phone is Not meant for serious gamers.Buyers must first do an denim update to ensure the phone function well.   
+ She loved it very much! I have purchased this phone for my Neice's birthday. She loved it very much. User interface is good, screen response is also as good as my samsung core duos. I feel worth for price.   
+ Works like a charm. Very fast and fluidic operation and no touch issues reported so far. Indeed a very good phone.Good product. Value for money   
+ Very nice, feature rich and budget phone. Delivered in less than 14 hours after placing order. Gentle delivery personnel and overall amazon service.   
+ Product is awesome . too much slim but camera quality is up to mark. Over all product is good. I will give 4.5 rating out of 5.0   
+ Product is awesome. But in 1st day of use the touch seemed lil bit off, however as Microsoft promised, when i updated it's software then all worked perfectly......Great product.Ausum product lumia 635 at affordable price   
+ Best mobile at this cost. Microsoft provides an awesome mobile with lots of features.I have been using the mobile for past 1 week. yaaay.. its really good compared with android phones.The best things about this model is the camera quality is really awesome.The pictures are at high quality.Buying a smartphone with all features i would suggest this model.. Amazon fast delivery..   
+ Excellent product by Microsoft(formerly Nokia).. They have really given the best mobile in this price range. The touch is very good and no problem occurs(as earlier reported,they have certainly fixed the touch screen issue) . The app store is large and all the popular apps are present free of cost.The camera quality is goodAnd ofcourse the amazon delivery was super fast. Even though I had asked for normal delivery(which takes 2-4 business days) i got it immediately the next day.

- Waste of money, Please do not buy this product. I have used this product for 15 days and found below Issues. 1). Battery shows 1% after using it for few Hours. So when you plug in the charger it will show as charging but the it will show 1% only. When you switched it off then it will show 100%.So this conclude that the Battery performance is very Poor, or there is some issue with the software interface related to battery.
+ Awesome mobile in awesome price......slow charging is an issue but overall its a great budget phone.
+ Amazing smartphone with too splendid performance This smartphone Coolpad Note 3 lite is undoubtedly the most excellent device in India in such a price.This device is working superbly. Everything on this device is perfect. You all can buy it without any hesitation. I can't also help saying about the great service of Amazon.in.
- Dont bye any product in amazon It's product is so worst it doesn't have back cam at least 2mp and videos is so dull so plz don't bye this and plz don't bye any product in amazon because thy is no return option I get problem wit it amazon take away the returning option
- This Coolpad note 3 lite is very light in performance (downside) This Coolpad note 3 lite is very light in performance (downside). Not up to the mark as per price too. Camera quality is pathetic. Other features are very good. Need software update on top priority.Not recommended to buy it.
+ average, Good at this price range the phone is quite handy and light weight. plastic body. camera is decent not very good.fingerprint sensor is working well.display is not good. sound is really poor. coolpad should use any other speakers to improve its sound.and display needs to be improved
+ Good performance I ordered on Feb 15, 2016 and got it next day It is identical to Honor 4X, with 4000 mAh battery. Super fast browsing. I would recommend this phone.
- CDMA NETWORK AND INTERNET PROBLEM I am a CDMA user and posting review with that view.No internet on CDMA SIM when called to Huwaii Support they said only 1x n/w will work but even thats not true in my case.However evdo network is appearing above signal.:) :)And in description its not mentioned. May be marketing guys.I am returning as its network isnt working.FLIPKART PEOPLE SAID THAT THEY MENTIONED IT VIZ CDMA INTERNET WILL NOT WORK AND SIMULTANEOUSLY THEY GIVE 2 OFFERS FOR CDMA INTERNET. LOLLLLLL SHALL WE TRUST U OR NOT FLIPKARTTTT

You can move apps to sd card.n battery department this phone will beat all smartphones under 8.5 KCall clarity is excellent. 
+ performance is good I ordered on Feb 15, 2016 and got it next day.front camera and rear camera is very good.Battery backup is superb , yesterday i use the mobile at 5:00 pm - 12:am battery going to drain 67% - 31%. when we put the charging it's going small heating problem, other times not at all.Browsing is very good.Display quality is very good.totally this mobile is very good .after i will update the some other reviews.
- Low Quality Product Hi I bought this product on 8th July which was the 1st flash sale.
+ The phone seems to be fine and so are the features, only concern being the high SAR value. Also the Product was delivered on time. 
- The phone worked fine for the first 12 days. But then I noticed that the battery would drain within a few hours of charging and post that the battery just gave up. Tried using another battery to switch the phone on and the phone works just fine.I am surprised that Lenovo is providing such poor quality products and flipkart backing them up.I will now have to either return the product to flipkart or search a Lenovo service station hoping for them to replace the battery.
+ Awsome Phone Bought it in first few seconds and delivered within 24 hours by flikart :) Best phone in range of 9999 and awesome features . 
- Phone gets heated up within 2m if u play game Phone will get really heated up like anything within 2m while playing game and we are not getting ear phones along with the phone. Think before buying. 
- Defective Quality Product Lenovo K3 note Received the phone and the very next day itself after one days use , we realized this phone has sound - hearing - speech quality issues, and I had lodged complaint to flipkart to have this replaced. What was being spoken was heard in a distorted manner in the other end and vise versa , they gave a troubleshooting guide instead!!! , which was also followed executed with no change , I feel cheated as long term customer of this site and want my money back. It is not my fault that Flipkart wanted us to try the trouble shooting guide and gave us time till 28th of Sept 2015. The phone does not serve the purpose of basic talk and listen properly and cant be used . I have re lodged the complaint to have this taken back and my money returned.  
+ awsome phone with great performance This is the best phone under 10k price tag. I like the look and feel of the phone which is way better than a 10k budget phone , the phone is amazingly light weight, which some people like and some don't, the performance is the best part of this mobile , its silky smooth whatever is thrown onto that processor it just does the job pretty smoothly, the only thing i am little worried is its battery, its 2900mah which could be a little more than 3k mah. The disappointing thing in the phone is that i expected a better camera. The camera is just above average. other than camera everything is awesome in this phone.some new features have been introduced in this model like wide touch, we do not have to use the lock button. The UI is designed very well and it looks fluidic. The touch is also super smooth.u can just go for it try for the new white colour i think it would look better in white ;) 
- Heat problem If i open any applications with in 5 Min it heated to much and Internet related issue. 
- very poor display strength...very fragile..its not gorilla hi all...I seriously doubt that this phone has corning OGS glass... i bought a new Mi4i few days(40-45 days) back from flipkart...and now this mi 4i with gorilla glass got cracked by a little thumb pressurenow touch is not working....and service center told me that it cost rs 12000
- Very Heating Please don't buy this product.its like a heating pad.I just started setting up the phone on first boot up the phone got heated up and it is really unbearable to use.
+ Complete satisfaction and more than expected. Bought this phone in the third flash sale because I was waiting to know the reviews about this phone from the previous customers. So far, this phone has been very impressive and I have no complaints (just a missing external memory card slot, which is not really a big deal). This phone was delivered in a day's time, which was good.
- Overheating of phone when it is getting charged/Updating I got the phone today though it is good to look there is problem of overheating when the phone is getting charged or updated.Really disappointed on seeing this just after opening box and charging the phone.Hope they fix this issue.Regret buying this phone. 
+ Overall Happy !!! Phone is pretty good No abnormal heating and the heat it generates is normal for a phone of this Kind !!First Xiaomi Product !!! Happy with the performance !!! Camera beyond my expectations !!!! Total worth for money Only concern is Service centers !!!! Hope ill not get any issues atleast for an year until I get another one !!!! 
+ Worth more than the price The Best in class. Fantastic user interface. Superb speed. Sleek look. Awesome battery back up. Fabulous display clarity. Smooth touch.On the whole this is a very good product at affordable price beats all the other market leaders. 
+ superb mobile looking very beautify and also looks very slim camera is good video recording is also good screen resolution is very good MiUI 6 is so good mobile performance is also good but little bit heating issue.... 
- Heating problem The phone performance is very nice and good camera but there is a heating problem in this phone.
+ Quality of the phone is good , its handy and good to use.
- Not that great as expected brought this last week.. not that happy with the phone .. claims faster battery charging.. i dont think thats happening next 64 bit octa core processor --- had tough time playing real racing game.. network issues. doesnt let me download .. need to submit it multiple times. only good thing i see is look and light weight. lot more has to be done to bring it on par with others phones. 
+ Marvellously BEAUTIFUL!! Using this phone since 4 weeks!!! Marvellous Phone with excellent battery life, excellent camera, excellent volume capabilities and storage. Didn't experience any kind of heating problem even without updating...I am really serious! I was very much disturbed to find the reviews indicating heating problems before buying this...but i have been using it since 4 weeks without that update of 860 MB and still no heating! I have played angry birds, Car races-3D, and even Iron Man-3 and other from google play without any Hanging or heating....!! So just go for it!! Battery needs charging only after 2 days of vigorous using!! I am a satisfied customer.... :-) 
+ Awesome Phone Best in class I have ordered this product from my friends account since there was a flash sale in the start.Having used this phone from past 3 months or probably more than that my conclusion is this phone is superb .Better than any so called branded phones.Heats up very little which is common in any snapdragon processor but neglibile,camera is awesome,front camera is excellent because of beautiy software, miui 6.5.6 User interface is quick,display is superb ,though a lag caused by 2gb ram when play 2k videos ,2k and above format requires 3 gb ram so thats fine .All in all if you compare battery ,display ,camera ,built quality,price ,looks ,software i give high five....Only suggestion to flipkart or Xiaomi is please stop this nonsense flash sale if this is marketting gimmick it is fine but have all the colors and provide sale and reachout to all people in one go....there is a chance that people will be fed of the duration of registration and may move on to other brands dont think they require  
+ Very Good Phone. Worth For Money I bought this phone couple of weeks back. I took the updates and it's working perfectly. There is no heating issue or anything. It may become a little bit warm when playing HD game / webpages using more graphics contents . It's not getting heated when using WiFI or 3G.Really worth for money. 
+ Awesome Phone! Brilliant Display, Excellent UI, Nice sound, Slim and light - are some of the features of this phone. Its been a week since I bought this phone and haven't faced any issues so far. The phone responds really well and doesn't feel like a low priced one. The heating issue that everyone are complaining about doesn't occur after the update (800 mb). 
+ Very good device for 13K I have bought more than 10 devices of MI from flipkart. All are good.Specially this is very good for 13k. Build quality is very good and very light weight and we can easily use it in single hand. 
+ The best budget phone. There were two reasons I ordered the phone, the promising 13MP camera and the FullHD display and man am I impressed. The camera is top notch in every way, be it picture quality or other features! It even has a manual mode! The flash works pretty well, giving out the same results that a DSLR would give in low light. Without the flash, though, there is quite a bit of noise which can be compromised with. The selfie camera is also very good, the pictures are comparable to those from iPhone. The display is brilliantly crafted as well. Perfect colors, size and lighting. To add to these, the battery is quite long lasting, the body is slim and sleek, the sound quality is good (speaker isnt too loud, but very clear), and the UI is beautiful (takes one day to get around, but you'll love it).To sum it up, you cannot get a more sophisticated, value for money device for this price. Cheers Xiaomi. Waiting for my freebie screen guard!    
- lots of heating issue camera is average lokss is owsome but it not the worth money product. lots of heating when using phone and battery is so poor
+ Best phone with Low Amount I got product within a day and its features are just ultimate. Camera, Touchscreen and sound is just awesome.. go for it , worth for money
- Good but not best Overall product is ok but not the best. this time Lenovo really make fool to Indian people by saying that they use Snapdragon 616 processor 1.7 Ghz octa core The processor was a Qualcomm Snapdragon but was disappointed to find 1.5 GHz Processor instead of 1.7GHz as mentioned here, also you get 1.8Gb of RAM instead of 2Gb.asks you to choose your default 4G/3G SIM after which the other SIM automatically gets assigned to 2G network which is very annoying
- none sense phone .. heating up to 40 degrees It's complete none sense phone. The specification is good, but it heats up immediately even after 2 video plays on YouTube. Forget about playing a game. I asked fro return and Flipkart rejected the request saying 38 degree battery temperature is OK and they don't think it's hot enough for a return. Apparently phone has a aluminum case and the battery/internal heat get transmitted immediately to outside and makes the phone very hot and you have to literally put it down on a table or sofa and use it!  
- Dnt buy it It has good screen quality and very good in looks and perfectly slim and very nice sound..but it has lots of problem that make you not to buy this product. It has heating issues and battery drains very quickly.Smartphone with so less battery power is of no use. 
- Blunder Looks were awesome but only looks not make the phone looks good. Drastic Heating problem and very very poor camera raise the questions on the performance of brand like lenovo and no keypad lights,no front flash and no earphones were the biggest drawbacks.Rest all is fine 
- camera and battery is not well In this product the camera and the battery is very bad when i would like to return my product the flipkart seller had call me and tell to check battery temperature is 45 is more or not but when i check it is nearly 47.5degrees to 48.5degrres. so i would to return my product.all the features are very nice compare to others. 
- Worthless product  Camera specification is fake, poor image quality  Heating problem, phone heats very quickly  Product is not worth for its price  If you ask for return, flipkart will refuse and seller will disapprove your return request  Dont waste your money on this phone 
- So Much Disappointment for Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus Received the next day after 23 March sale , thanks to flipkart to deliver quickly. Look is very good.(Golden). The most disappointment one is battery and heating issue. 
+ A Great Mobile Phone for what you pay! A pretty decent mobile considering the price. Please ignore the negative reviews here. I dont know why so much of complaint. I really liked this mobile. It got all the good things to tell. I bought this phone as gift for my wife. I was looking for this phone because of the features and its 5" FHD screen size. Other mobiles with same or more specifications were having a screen size larger than 5" which was not handy. Using this phone extensively since two days. This is my second Lenovo purchase. First one was K3 Note 
+ best budget phone with little heating effect This phone is good at this price range. Camera (both front and back), sound, display, look, touch response and everything is very good except it has some heating effect. This is the review after using one whole day 
- Poor Camera Quality Camera is very poor quality. Rear Camera is 13 Mp but working like 1 MP. Front Camera is little bit good as compare to rear camera. Overheating problem with this phone. If you ask for return policy to flipkart they deny you and will not return your phone.  
- Lenovo is doing well with the smartphone segment, now they have Moto too and to slap Xiaomi's upcoming Redmi Note 3 and Coolpad Note 3 they launched K4 note so I expected something more from Lenovo. Don't get me wrong K4 note is a really good device but at this price tag, it fails to do what it should do.  
-  so guys be ready to consequences if you receive a defective piece from a brand like lenovo. And amazon is not definitely APNI DUKAN.  
- Worst deal ever, mobile is heating to much. No support from amozon Due to heat mobile every time goes hang.  
- Very very poor performance. I have to click contacts and wait for few seconds for the contacts page to come.. Its really really horrible. I was using Sony Xperia and it was amazing just that i wanted a dual sim i purchased this product. Please dont buy this product.  
- Donot purchase this product ... after using 5 to 10 mins phone will over heat and speaker issue. Donot buy any product from Amazon because they wonot give any warranty for product they will tell you need to contact lenovo customer care.Lenovo customer care also not supporting after giving many call. Better you can buy product from Flipkart then they will give gurrenty and replacement for 1 month on product. I have done very big mistake for buying product from amazon evne they wonot care customer. Better you can buy product from Flipkart then they will give 1 month return and replacement gurrenty  
- Not worth owning a Lenovo Mobile.They were taking too much time to fix it so asked for a replacement, but sadly Lenovo does not provide a replacement and only repairs. Also the after sales service of Lenovo is poor there are CSA's available but cannot solve your problem.  
- Worst phone for me. The first two dayz was awsm for me. From the third day, the screen freeze again again, the touch responce was so poor that when ever i restart the phone, its didnt wrk for 10 min.But irrirated with the touch nd touch pad responce.  
- I Purchased this mobile from Amazon and i facing problem with proximity sensor. because it is not working on my phone. i contacted lenovo support but as given his solution problem not solve. and amazon can't replace this product after 10 days. so now what i can do. i purchased new phone but at 11 th day i need repairing on my new phone. So i suggest dont purchase this mobile and also from amazon.  
- Very very poor performance. I have to click contacts and wait for few seconds for the contacts page to come.. Its really really horrible. I was using Sony Xperia and it was amazing just that i wanted a dual sim i purchased this product. Please dont buy this product.  
- This is the best oven I have ever bought. I can cook any dish in the world on it while not taking a call. It also doubles as a iron. It's missing the steam feature that most competitive irons come with but nothing much to complain, with the heat it developes no wrinkle can stand.  
- Donot purchase this product ... after using 5 to 10 mins phone will over heat and speaker issue. Donot buy any product from Amazon because they wonot give any warranty for product they will tell you need to contact lenovo customer care.Lenovo customer care also not supporting after giving many call. Better you can buy product from Flipkart then they will give gurrenty and replacement for 1 month on product.  
- If you get a defective piece then its as good as getting cheated by Lenovo.After a software upgrade my phone stopped charging (would only charge when switched off) and sent it to the service center. They were taking too much time to fix it so asked for a replacement, but sadly Lenovo does not provide a replacement and only repairs. Also the after sales service of Lenovo is poor there are CSA's available but cannot solve your problem.  
- Phone got struck..and can't even restart.Suddenly phone is showing some Chinese symbols and got struck, I cant even allow me to restart/switch off the mobile to get back to normal mode. then I waited till battery dead after that it got switched off. It was really a painful process to get back it as normal mode from this Chinese command prompt mode.  
- i purchase intex Eco 102e mobile i am not getting headset mobile if it's passable send again....  
- Always disconnects from network. hope this phone is for EMERGENCY CALLS ONLY..!!  
- In technically it is waste of never buy intex mobile. on receiving side humming sound is deliver . i also talked with other intex mobile user they said yes same problem is on their mobile set but after some time the problem is corrected automtically.  
- not as per the description...besides they hide sincere and correct post  
- Poor build quality and poor voice quality. Looks more like a toy.  
- very disappointed by the product and amazon service.

+ Mobile is very light and good looking feature phone. We can not compare any mobile with any one in this budget range. Battery backup is good. Audio clarity is good. Voice clarity is too good in this range....voice clarity is very crisp. A screen guard is given attached to the mobile. It is taking 2 hours to charge fully. Bluetooth capability is good.

+ Superb product. A great value for the money spent. I brought this as a gift to my maid for Diwali 2015. I noticed the mobile is very sleak and light weighted, so very easy to handle. Also has dual sim card slots. I'm planning to buy another one for myself. So that I can keep it as a backup for my smartphone.

+ Intex phone great phone 5 star.  
+ Its a nice phablet. It looks very stylish ma frenz told under 15k its a very good phone. And specifications are good. Second day i was little confused bcoz i fully charged the battery nd switched off the phone then after 2 hours wen i took my phone it was very hot i dont know y. Wen i switched on the battery level was decresed to 69% i was shocked. Without using the fon fon decresed 31% battery. But after that i used for playing music taking pictures videos etc.. At that time the battery ok good efficient. Regarding camera primary of 13 mb is not upto the level but its ok. Front cam is the best. Then i played many videos dolby effect was good my frenz too liked it. But wen i played a HD movie it was stuck means voice wad going nd video was stuck nd play stuck nd play. I dont know y its happened due to fon problem or video player problem or videos problem. Anyway i changed the player to another video player but still the problem arises. Please suggest me how it can be corrected nd tell y it was like that.
