+ Premium Phone at Budget Price Its almost 15 days since I am using this #Superphone.The phone delivers more than expected. Its beyond expectations.New Observations - Build Quality - Excellent Build quality. It survived a 5 feet drop on a marble flooring. Nothing happened to phone at all, not even a tiny scratch on the screen or at the back.User Interface - Now, as i am used to this UI, it feels pretty good now. Letv has also announced next version of this UI, ie., EUI 6, so on UI part, no complaints.Battery - Though battery life was somewhat low on initial days, but now, I get decent battery life that lasts for 1 whole day. Moreover, battery life would also be optimized with the new OTA update.Customer Service - Haven't visited a service center as of now, but had a talk with Letv Customer Care regarding some minor software bug. Unlike other companies, Letv customer care executive was listening to the query very patiently and his response was also satisfactory.
+ Premium build and value for money Pros: full hd display is good..viewing angle really great.looks premium.. no body will believe this phone costs only 11k.. because lookwise can comparable with above 20 k phones finger print sensor 8 out of 10 times working flawelessly i experienced no lag so far quick charging is grt from 15 percent to 100 percent in 90 minutes IR BLASTER supports all kind of tv but in ac blue star and o genaral support is not there. Built quality is simply awesome....full metal for 10 k is really nice cons: ram management is poor .. out of 3 gb ram after installed 20 apps..... only 700 to 800 mb free ram available all time.... camera is not as good as mi4i and k3 note eui is okay but cant compete with miui.....battery is above average onl not too good.. but fast charging is there so v can satisfy with it while charging i experienced warm on sides. but thats common in quick charging final verdict: value for every penny u invested....
- Heat Issue Phone looks good Use it like toy in show case Major problem is heating issue -- U cannot spend more time with this phone if you use it for long calls your ear will burn if you want to browse more your hand will burn.
- Good phone but very poor Battery and Horrible Camera I was in a dilemma whether to go for K4 Note or Le 1S and after a lot of reviews, i gave it for Le1S. I was so excited that i could book the phone in the flash sale and even more excited till the phone arrived. The phone looks extremely stylish and premium. However, am so disappointed with its Battery performance and Horrible Camera.
- No gyroscope,poor software,battery drain and heating It's a pretty good deal. Most of the buyers already know its pros. If you get a chance to buy it then you should go ahead. But...you should know that they don't include a gyroscope in the phone for some reason.(which means no photo spheres or games that use the sensor don't work) Not a big deal for most people.I also faced heating issues constantly. And, the battery drained really fast which is unusual. The skin also neglects to show a battery graph. While I hate skins in general, the eUI skin isn't as intuitive or feature rich as MIUI 7. The company has a long way to go before they catch up with Xiaomi. Hopefully, the development community will thrive.Call quality is subpar at best. I didn't find the voice clear or loud enough at max volume.Camera is quite terrible. Not sure what went wrong. Shots are usually blurry or extremely grainy.It's also a bit worrying that the company hasn't confirmed an update to Marshmallow yet.
- Heating heavily and drastic charging if we use phone 30 mins .heating the phone heavily.look is good.charging is not up-to the mark.only 1 gb ram is available.
- Worst camera quality not Recommended.I bought this phone & I was Satisfied of its design and Other Features such as fingerer Sensor lock.but I am total Dissatisfied with its camera as the picture quality is worst. Clicked Picture get Blured when I zoom it. Please guys those are photos freaks please do not buy this phone. another thing which i realized is that Comapny Gave 3GB RAm in this phone but customer will only get 1.2 GB available free memory which is too low.
+ Excellent Product from Letv.Fully charged battery from 0% to 100% it took exactly 1hour30min. Used it for few min and slept. Next day morning the battery level is still 100%. I am very surprised. I used the mobile for another 15min still it is 100%. Battery assistant is in Ultra-long stand by mode. I think it does all this wonders. Extraordinary battery!! Don't believe the negative comments about the battery. Regarding fast charging, my phone got charged 65% in 45minutes and I felt WOW. No lag at all so far.. Will update further.. 
- LETV 1s GREAT DESIGN LOOKS WITH POOR PERFORMANCE Flipkart's service is excellent I GOT MY MOBILE ON 4 the FEB MORNING BUT LETV 1S MOBILE IS NOT FULFILL YOUR EXPECTATIONS.Average mobile great design build look.but there are problems like camera quality is very poor,minor software bug.battery life is not so good,heating issues.Overall average mobile.
- Not Worthy 1. heating very big problem... after using 15-20 minute it start heating a lot 2. Its Battary drain very fast, it doen't long last for 1 day. 3. camera Quality is very very poor.
